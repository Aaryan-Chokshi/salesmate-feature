    "prompt": "What is incremental sales? Definition and formula ",
    "completion": "Marketing is all about being memorable to potential customers.
By consistently engaging with them and making a good impression, you increase the chances that they will immediately think of your brand when they need a product or service you offer. 

And the primary objective of putting in marketing efforts is to increase demand and boost revenue.

But the only way you can ensure that your efforts are paying off is by measuring the right metric of the campaign. 

Which is that metric? – Incremental Sales! 

Indeed many other factors are essential, such as conversion rate, cost per lead, engagement, and more.

But incremental sales is a metric that will help evaluate whether your marketing effort is showing results or not.

But before we see how you can measure incremental sales, let’s take a quick look at what exactly is incremental sales.

What is incremental sales? 
Incremental sales is a metric that helps determine the difference between actual sales you generate during a specific timeframe and the estimated sales you would have generated.

And, because the growth in sales is usually a result of promotional campaigns, it’s also referred to as a sales metric or a KPI (key performance indicator) that helps evaluate marketing effectiveness and performance of campaigns.

The two most important things here are baseline sales, which refers to the revenue you generate without marketing efforts. And the second thing is campaigns, which in this concompletion, are the marketing channels you choose to reach your potential customers. 

So, this includes campaigns such as PPC advertisements, influencer marketing, social media advertisement, influencer marketing, and other such campaigns. 

Why do you need to measure incremental sales? 
Measuring incremental sales truly has its perks.

It is a KPI that can shape the way your sales numbers grow. And, if the revenue you’ve evaluated after measuring incremental sales is high, the campaign’s performance is good.

Whereas, if the numbers are negative, there are areas where improvement could be made.

Incremental sales can help identify loopholes in the sales process, enables better allocation of marketing funds, and helps identify shortcomings. As a result, increased profit is achieved.

Moreover, keeping track of incremental sales can help better strategize your upcoming promotional campaigns.  

How to calculate incremental sales?  
The incremental sales formula highlights the growth in sales due to promotional activities during a set timeframe.

Let’s learn how to calculate incremental sales to evaluate the success of marketing campaigns.

Incremental sales formula: 

Incremental Sales = Total Sales – Baseline Sales 

Now, let’s clear out the concepts mentioned in the formula.  

Total sales: It is the revenue your business generated during a set timeframe when the marketing campaigns were active.  

Baseline sales: Itis the revenue you had projected your business would have generated during a set timeframe without marketing campaigns. 

Calculating baseline sales can be a little tricky! However, educated guesswork can help make this easier.

A common approach is calculating the company’s average annual sales growth (without the marketing promotion).  

Now, let’s plug in some real numbers in the formula and take a look at an incremental sales example for a better understanding: 

Let’s assume total sales for,

2021: $170,000 

2022: $200,000 

As mentioned earlier, let’s roughly take an average of the last three years of average annual sales growth (promotion-free) for baseline sales.

2018-2019 = $20,000 

2019-2020 = $25,000 

2020-2021 = $30,000 

Average annual sales growth = $20000 + $25000 + $30000 = $75,000 

Average annual sales growth = $75000 ÷ 3 = $25,000 

Now as we know the average annual sales growth, can plug that into  

Baseline sales for 2022 = $170000 (2021) + $25000 (average annual sales growth) = $145,000 

So, the final figure would be: 

Incremental Sales = $200000 – $145000 = $55,000 

Now that we’ve seen how to calculate incremental sales let’s look at the best practices."
