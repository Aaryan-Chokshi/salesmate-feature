{"prompt": "How to build a strong sales pipeline for consulting firms?", "completion": "Key TakeawaysModern consulting businesses should have a strong marketing engine to build a solid sales pipeline.Strong sales pipeline results in increased conversions, better customer relationships, and organized processes for pipeline management.The primary steps to building an ideal sales pipeline involve generating leads effectively, prioritizing them, and qualification by the sales reps.
According to a statistic, only 27% of the leads get closed. That means you need constant new prospects to close more deals. 
To accomplish that, your marketing team needs to set up its lead generation engine, and your sales team must constantly qualify leads to build a solid foundation. 
In order to do that, the marketing team must constantly come up with new leads, qualify them, and send them across the sales team to make the pipeline rich. 
I’m writing this article from a slightly different perspective. I believe modern consulting businesses should have a strong marketing engine to build a solid sales pipeline.  
So, let’s dive right in. 
How to build a strong sales pipeline for your consulting business? 
Building your ideal sales pipeline consists of 4 key steps:

Keep the marketing lead generation engine running 
Qualify leads for MQL 
Qualification by the sales team 
Create a meaningful sales pipeline 

Step 1: Keep the marketing lead generation engine running 
Every successful sales conversion begins with collecting the leads, qualifying them for marketing, and submitting them to the salespeople.  
To get things in motion, marketers must take care of the basics: 

Identify your target audience 
Define the kind of content they would appreciate 
Plan a content execution strategy 
Distribute content meaningfully 
Collect leads through forms and newsletter signups 

1. Identify your target audience 
Building Ideal Customer Personas (ICPs) is the first step toward your digital marketing strategy and content creation.  
Start by identifying your target client.  
Research the critical decision-makers and power players capable of making the purchase decision. 
Segment and build a detailed audience list based on demographics, purchase intent, behaviors, and the goals they’d want to accomplish in the future by partnering with you and utilizing your services. 
Here’s an example of ICP for a consultancy that provides marketing services to SaaS platforms. 

Need more help with creating a customer persona? Download our free template. 
2. Define the kind of content they would appreciate 
Every marketing department has to create content to generate leads. 
Generally, for consulting, informative blogs, research reports, and whitepapers are more appropriate for your audience.  
You can write more content that includes problem diagnosis, strategy implementation, market research reports, or financial planning.
These are sure to help your audience and resonate with them. 
For instance, Animalz – a content marketing consulting company, writes thought leadership topics like these and gained attention from their target audience.

People find podcasts more entertaining, as they can enjoy them on the go, on their own time. 
Look at McKinsey – A global management consultancy, and the topics they cover in their podcast: 

3. Prepare a content execution plan 
Before creating content, you need a solid content plan, and Cluster Approach is the best option right now.  
In simple words, a cluster is a process of writing multiple child topics to gain authority over a parent topic.  
For example: 
Parent Topic: Consulting services for SaaS   
Child Topic: How much does a consulting charge to a SaaS business? 
It depends on the level of depth of a subject.
Here’s an example of a parent topic, “Business Strategy Consulting.” Look at the child topics based on the funnel stage: 
Top of the Funnel Middle of the Funnel Bottom of the Funnel What is business strategy consulting? Best business strategy consulting firms in New York Business strategy consulting for small business Types of business strategy consulting Marketing business strategy consulting Business strategy consulting for finance businesses  Sales business strategy consulting A landing page on Business Service Consultancy 
4. Distribute your published content 
Now that you’ve created your cluster topics and suitable content around them, you must tell the world.  
More specifically, it would help to let your desired audience know that you’ve published content and what it’s about.  
There are several ways to tell your audience about your published content. 
Post on social media and groups: Create posts about the problems and solutions your audience seeks.
Post them on social media platforms like Facebook, LinkedIn, and community groups to help increase your brand identity.
Associating links with social media posts can give you more traffic as well. 
Email marketing: Send a glimpse of new content to your subscribers. It’s a great way to talk to your audience and keep them engaged. 
Aside from blogs, send the latest industry updates, newsletters, or other weekly tips related to your audiences’ challenges.
It will resonate with them and keep you on top of their mind as an industry expert. 
Publish content on third-party channels like Medium: Medium is a great place to publish blogs and articles apart from your website.
With over 100 million monthly active users, Medium can deliver quality traffic.
Influencer marketing: Partner with influencers in your industry and leverage their influence to target a vast audience.
It will help establish you as a credible source in the eyes of their followers. 
YouTube and podcasts: As mentioned earlier, channels like video and podcast marketing are other super advantageous ways to speak to your audience.   
5. Collect leads through Forms and Newsletter signups 
Remember, the marketing team’s goal is to generate sales leads and bring more money to the table.
The goal of all the educational content should be to bring visitors down the funnel to your service pages (i.e., landing pages).
Your service pages (or money pages) aim to tell visitors about your brand, the value you provide, and the benefits you can bring through your offerings.
For instance, Rapidops – one of the finest digital transformation companies in the world, shows their approach on their service page like this: 

Contact forms and newsletter forms will help you accomplish that.   
Insert fields relevant to your business needs, keep the form simple and short, and use clear labels for each field.
A simple, clearly labeled form allows visitors to fill it out quickly and not lose interest.  
Here, if your CRM software offers web form creation, it’s easier for you to bring all the leads directly into the system for further steps. 
Step 2: Qualify leads for MQL  
You have successfully generated leads and stored them in your CRM. But what’s next?  
You need to qualify the leads you’ve collected and then forward them to the sales, so they can put efforts in the right direction.  
Lead Scoring is an effective way to qualify leads as per your ICP. It assigns a score to your leads based on ideal client traits, demographics, and interests.   
Lead scoring answers a basic question: Does a lead have the potential to become an ideal client for your firm?
The more a lead resonates with your ICP, the higher the score.   
There are many lead scoring models in the market, and it is up to you to choose from and implement them in your lead-scoring process.

Here’s a typical example of a lead scoring process: 

I’d highly recommend not picking some random model for lead scoring. 
But understand what matters to your business and create a custom model for yourself.

Step 3: Qualification by the members of the sales
Once the marketing team scores and assigns leads to salespeople, they have their qualifications.
This is where they contact leads to collect valuable information by asking business-specific questions to understand whether they are a good match.
Such qualifications mainly occur on sales calls.
I’ll not take up your time on these questions, but if you want to read more about it, I’ve plugged in an excellent resource below.
Read more: 21+ Sales qualifying questions to stop wasting time on wrong leads 
Step 4: Create a meaningful sales pipeline 
This is the most critical aspect, but many businesses build random pipelines.
It is ideal for making a sales pipeline that matches your sales process or aligns with the goals because it will visually represent the ongoing sales process.
To make the correct sales pipeline, you need answers to these questions: 

What is the standardized sales process that your business follows?  
How many stages do you need?  
What’s the importance of each stage for you? 

You can quickly turn your sales process into a pipeline if you have answers to these simple questions. Any modern CRM can help you with it.
Let’s assume that you run an IT consulting. Here’s a typical example of how a sales pipeline would look like.

If you want to learn more about the stages of sales pipelines, I’ve added an FAQ at the bottom of the article.
So, there you go; if your lead gen engine is working, and you constantly push qualified leads forward, you’ll have a healthy sales pipeline for your consulting.
3 tips for maintaining a healthy sales pipeline 
Congratulations, you’ve built a strong pipeline for your salespeople to follow.
However, maintaining a constant lead gen and nurturing flow is another matter. Here are some fantastic tips for maintaining a sales pipeline.
1. Monitor, analyze, and update the pipeline on a weekly basis  
Check the sales pipeline weekly to determine the number of qualified leads and how many conversions have occurred.
In addition, it will estimate the pipeline’s performance, allowing you to make additional changes when required.  
While updating the pipeline, remove a potential poor-performing deal or a bad one to save time and effort on that lead.  
Analyze any leads that are dropping off and adjust your sales process accordingly. 
2. Maintain regular relationships with your leads  
It is essential to regularly keep in touch with your leads to build relationships and keep your consulting on top of their minds.  
Since only some leads are ready to purchase, establishing a relationship is essential.  
Send personalized emails and informative newsletters every week to keep them entertained. 
  

Nurture leads and achieve industry-best conversionsSend highly personalized emails automatically through Sequences.Explore Email Sequences
3. Create content that educates and provides value to your target customers
Create blogs, articles, and whitepapers that are for the sole purpose of educating your customers on their pain points and solutions.
Doing so rather than just promoting your services will establish your business as a trusted consultant. 
Conclusion 
For your consulting to succeed, ensure you have established a strong sales pipeline management.
A strong pipeline is developed by generating leads consistently.
Ensure qualified leads are generated constantly by the marketing team and assigned to the sales.
More importantly, match your consulting pipeline with the sales process.
By implementing these practices, your consulting can increase the chances of converting prospects into customers and drive revenue growth.
We hope you’ve learned a lot from this article. 
Frequently asked questions 
What are the typical stages of a sales pipeline for consulting?

MQLs

This is the ideal first stage, where the marketing team forwards MQLs to sales. These are scored leads, but still, salespeople have to ask manual questions. 

First contact 

Your salespeople should begin connecting with leads to understand more about their challenges and purchase intentions of your service. 

Meeting booked 

This is the next stage, where the salespeople schedule an appointment and book a meeting to proceed with the proposal.  

Proposal presented 

The proposal will contain an overview of the business and value you provide, along with the qualifications of the personnel, features, and pricing and payment terms.
Showcase your unique value proposition and highlight why your consulting should be the best.  

In negotiation 

In this stage, both the parties, the sales team, and the client, agree on what the consulting offers regarding features, benefits, and pricing. 

Contract in motion 

Here, both parties agree to move forward with the transaction after both parties initiate a signing contract or the purchase order. This usually is the last step of the sales cycle.

Why establishing a sales pipeline is important for your consulting business?
-Increased conversions 
-Achieve better customer relationships 
-An organized sales process for pipeline management 
-To achieve sales targets on time and bring new business
-To deeply understand buying journey and improve experiences
-Have a unified sales and marketing collaboration for new business development

{"prompt": "ANUM sales qualification: All you need to know!", "completion": "Key Takeaways22% of sales reps reported qualification for sales as the most arduous task.The ANUM sales framework lets you easily qualify based on authority, need, urgency, and money.You can set your qualification process on automation with a chatbot.
According to a study, 22% of sales reps reported sales qualification as the most challenging part of their sales process.  
Maybe those still need to introduce a sales lead qualification framework!  
Various sales methodologies can help you qualify the actual buyers. And today, we are discussing one of the most effective sales frameworks- ANUM.
Moreover, you can set your qualification process on autopilot.
So, let’s find all the nitty-gritty of the ANUM framework.
What is the ANUM sales qualification framework? 
Ken Krogue develops the ANUM framework. It is a lead qualification framework that takes a customer-centric approach and helps sales reps identify sales opportunities.  
It is a restructured version of the BANT framework where authority is prioritized over budget.  
Prospecting isn’t easy. Reps invest a lot of effort and time in contacting the right audience.  
In such a scenario, realizing that you reached out to an irrelevant prospect is devastating. 
ANUM is a practical framework as it qualifies based on whether they have decision-making powers or not.
Also, beginning your sales pitch focusing on a budget can be daunting. Here’s why the ANUM framework seems effective, as it considers money criteria later.
Moreover, this framework helps reps save time and effort by deciding whether they are dealing with the right prospects or need to look for the correct ones.   
Let’s understand each qualification criterion of ANUM.
The complete process of the ANUM qualification framework

1. Authority  
You just can’t afford to work on a lead that has no power to make the purchasing decision.
This is why the ANUM framework prioritizes authority. It lets you discover whether you are pitching your winning script to the decision-maker or not. 
But who is/are the potential decision-makers?  
Well- it depends.  
There is no perfect definition of the decision-maker. It is purely subjective to the company and its organizational structure.
At some companies, it may be a CFO or a departmental head; in some processes, there may be a group of people who need to be involved throughout the process, and so on.
The technique is to ask the right qualifying question to the MQLs to discover whether they have the decision-making authority or not.
To understand the authority of a prospect to make the purchase decision, you should ask the questions mentioned below:

Can you help me know your company’s buying process, especially with purchasing a product or service like ours? 
Is there anyone else from your team that needs to be included in this conversation? 
How are purchasing decisions typically made in your organization for products/services like ours?
Who is responsible for making the final purchase decision? 
Can you include the (decision maker) in our call? 
Can you help me with the coordinates of (the decision maker) to contact them directly? 

What if you discover that the lead you’re communicating with for sales isn’t the decision-maker? 
Well, you shouldn’t cut off the lead who isn’t the decision-maker, as they can serve as a bridge to reach the person concerned.  
2. Need  
Once you’ve tapped the decision-maker, you must understand their requirements and expectations from a brand like yours.  
Understanding their pain points and taking the conversation in the right direction is vital.
At this stage, you should be aware of their role and responsibilities. This helps you to offer a tailored solution to them. 
Identifying customers’ needs would help you offer a consultive sales approach that boosts the probability of deal conversion. 
Nearly 53% of sales representatives believe the consultative selling approach makes their sales process more efficient. 
As this method considers having a consultation session with the potential buyer that caters to their requirement.
Below are the questions you can ask the lead to understand their needs: 

What’s the key problem your company/ team/ department faces? 
What’s the source of this key problem? 
What’s the goal your team/company aims at achieving? 
Why hasn’t it been addressed before? 
What would be the ideal solution for this problem?  

3. Urgency 
At this stage, you must determine the importance and extremity of your prospect’s purchase plan.
This phase is even denoted as priority and timing in some other frameworks like (BANT, FAINT, CHAMP, etc.)  
This stage evaluates how urgently your prospect requires the solution to their problem.  
However, there is an urgency in an ideal situation at this stage since you already know the prospects are facing problems and need a solution.
So, here’s how you can even directly discover these factors by asking a question like:

What’s the timeframe for getting the problem fixed? 
How long can you wait to get the problem solved? 
Where does this solution stand on your priority list? 
How important is it to get this solution in place? 

Also, you can even discover the urgency of the purchase by getting to know the company’s general news, like its structural changes, mergers, acquisition, etc.
4. Money 
The above qualification will help you understand who you are selling to and how to pitch your product as the solution to their problem. 
But you must qualify your prospect for the most important stage- budget.  
Though self-explanatory, the budget takes a backseat when you communicate with the right person and offer them the required solution.  
The businesses have a budget range per the market prices, so if you can convince your prospects that your solution is a game-changer, they will probably be flexible about it. 
Through the below qualifying questions, you provide certainty about their budget: 

Do you have a budget for this solution? 
How much are you willing to spend on an accurate solution?  
Would you mind spending higher than you’re planned budget on this solution? 
Is there anything else you’re currently allocating the budget on? 

Let’s find out how you can implement ANUM to qualify leads for sales.  
An example of the ANUM qualification framework
This example will help you understand how to leverage ANUM for qualification.

Wrapping up 
ANUM sales framework is a smart sales methodology that helps to qualify the prospect.
It stands for ANUM (authority, need, urgency, money).
If authority is something you aim to qualify for initially, go for the ANUM qualification framework.

{"prompt": "MQL Vs. SQL Vs. PQL: What’s the difference?", "completion": "Key TakeawaysMarketing qualified leads (MQLs) are those potential customers who interacted with your brands and showed interest in your product/services.A sales-qualified lead is a prospect that has moved from MQL to sales accepted lead and is now interested in a sales conversation to make a purchase.Product qualified leads (PQLs) are the ones that have used or are currently using your product/service and indicating an upgrade in some manner.
21% of salespeople and marketers are unsatisfied with their current lead qualification process.    
Maybe we need to understand the qualification process truly from the core.    
There are three big qualification stages as per teams – MQL, SQL, and PQL (They all have different qualifying grounds).  
This blog covers the main differences between MQLs, PQLs, and SQLs also how you can minimize your sales and marketing efforts with automation.
What is a marketing qualified lead?  
Marketing qualified leads (MQLs) are potential prospects that have interacted with your brand’s marketing activities somewhere at some point.  
Such interactions reflect their interest in your product/services.   
For example, you are a SaaS-based company, and a few web visitors sign up for your product webinar on your website. Then, these are marketing-qualified leads for you.  
There are various factors based on which marketing teams create personas to define their ideal customer profile. These factors may include age, gender, demographics, etc.  
Apart from this, MQLs are qualified based on engagement activities such as Live Chat/chatbot interaction on the website, web page visits, Web Form sign up for free downloadable resources, etc. 
The top behavioral attributes to create a qualification strategy for MQLs are:  
What is a product qualified lead?  
Product qualified leads (PQLs) are those prospects who’ve experienced your product’s functioning with a freemium service.   
This is the stage where your prospects are in the moment to begin understanding your product/services from its functioning ability.  
Also, they are at the stage to provide you with valuable feedback to improve the product in terms of user experience or anything more.  
For a lead to be a PQL, it must have used the product in real, so if a lead has just signed up for a free trial or enrolled for a freemium service, it wouldn’t be considered PQL.    
PQL is a qualification stage for B2B companies that work on the freemium model.   
Their purchase intent is purely based on how well your product has proven as a solution to them.    
Every company has its criteria for PQL that mainly decide at which stage of the buying cycle lead will fall.    
Below are some behavioral attributes to create a PQL qualification strategy. 

What is a sales qualified lead? 
A sales qualified lead is a potential customer that has moved from MQL to sales accepted lead and is now interested in a sales conversation to make a purchase.  
Sales qualified leads (SQLs) are highly interested in the purchase, express ample interest through their response, and are willing to listen to discuss the budgeting, benefits, and more.   
Every company has its qualifying criteria, but a lead to be an SQL must have shown enough intent to buy your product/services.   
Typically, SQLs are progressed from MQLs or PQLs (in the case of B2B).   
MQL Vs SQL Vs PQL: How do they differ?  
Below table will help you get deeper insights into MQL vs SQL, PQL vs MQL and PQL vs SQL.
It will give you a clear picture of each lead’s stage of the customer’s journey, intent, and extent of interest in becoming a paying customer. 
Parameters MQLs PQLs SQLs When are they tagged? MQLs are tagged when they consume your brand’s marketing content resource.    PQLs are tagged when they become unpaid users of your brand’s product/services. SQLs are tagged when they express a deep interest in getting into a deal-closing conversation.  What is their level of interest? Open to the idea of sales Open to knowing the value proposition Open for the sales pitch and deal closing Are they engaged in marketing activities?  Engaged Little  No Are they using your product/services?  No Fully Showed interest in the direction To whom with they communicate with?  Marketing people IT support and salespeople Salespeople At which stage of the customer journey do they lie?  Awareness Consideration and Decision Decision 
From MQL to PQL to SQL: Lead qualification flow in one go!   
To understand the flow of MQLs, SQLs, and PQLs, let’s look at a typical funnel in B2B space.   
See the visual representation of the lead qualification flow of MQLs, SQLs, and PQLs.  

Visitors come to your website through various inbound lead generation and marketing efforts (ads, social media, content, etc.).   
At this very first stage, they will start showing interest in your brand with engagement activities like checking out your website, blogs, and video content, downloading resources, attending webinars, etc.   
Those who meet the set-up lead qualifying criteria for MQLs are considered suitable to go with nurturing.   
Those who don’t meet the criteria are considered not useful or unqualified leads.  
MQLs are further nurtured. This lead nurturing helps to know more about your customers for better sales targeting.   
Salespeople will start interacting and try to qualify these leads with various qualifying questions further.  
So, with every positive response to the qualification questions, these sales accepted leads progressed to SQLs or unqualified leads.  
Moreover, your reps need to engage with these SQLs to convince them to purchase or take the product trial for free.  
Sales qualification is a key step to creating opportunities, and the best way to do it is by following a qualification framework!  
Some MQLs become well aware of your product/services through your aggressive marketing.   
So, they sign up for a free trial and ultimately become users.   
So, once a lead start using your product/services, they fall into a PQL list.   
Often, most PQLs get converted into paying customers themselves.  
Can you automate the lead qualification?  
Yes, you can automate your lead qualification process for MQLs and PQLs.  
But SQLs mostly communicate verbally with the sales reps, so we cannot set any qualification criteria.  
See the table to check on what grounds we qualify MQLs. 
Qualify MQLs Qualify PQLs Based on actions performed  Based on behaviour  
Leads qualify based on their engagement and profile fit. So, once a lead meets the lead score threshold, it will automatically qualify.
Then, your marketing team sends it to the sales team to further qualify with multiple efforts (sales calls, text, and email sequences).
See the step-by-step learning here: 
With a lead scoring tool, you can set your qualification of leads as MQLs on auto-pilot.   
For instance, you can automatically qualify leads based on their email engagement; you can set up email activity triggers (clicked, opened, response, etc.) and assign scores for each condition so that your software automatically takes actions and assigns scores to the lead to qualify.  
Better understand with the visual below: 

Like above, you can set various triggers and conditions for lead scoring actions to qualify leads for your sales team based on what your business demands.  
Automated lead scoring becomes more effective with the support of a CRM, as you can streamline your marketing and sales team efforts from one centralized platform.  
How about a CRM + automation platform that serves…

Bottomline: MQL vs SQL vs PQL
Leads express their intent differently at each stage throughout a customer’s journey.
As we studied in the blog;

MQLs are open to the idea of sales in your product/services.   
SQLs are open to knowing the value proposition. 
PQLs are open for the sales pitch and deal closing. 

And to better understand these stages, study the various comparison like MQL vs SQL, PQL vs SQL or completely like MQL vs SQL vs PQL.
Understanding of quality of leads will move your business in the right direction.
Typically for a B2B company, making a qualification strategy for MQLs, PQLs, and SQLs will shorten their buying cycle.  
For a better sales process, sales and marketing teams must sit together to understand their lead behavior and buyer’s journey.
Moreover, marketing and sales teams both need to understand the flow of leads from the sales funnel for an efficient sales process.
And to ease your marketing and sales efforts, look for a unified customer platform that helps to facilitate your day-to-day tasks easily.

What is PQL vs MQL?
PQLs and MQLs show interest in your product/services on different bases. For example, PQLs express interest in usage-based, whereas MQLs express interest in feature-based.  

Who converts PQLs into paying customers? 
The conversion of PQLs is a collaborative effort of your marketing and sales teams. Firstly, the marketing teams aimed to attract visitors to sign up and use the product/services to become PQLs. Then, your sales teams will facilitate PQLs to upgrade their free plan and become paying users."}

The criteria include; leads from a specific geographical location or company, job type (incased B2B) etc.   
Here’s the list of the most important qualifying criteria for scoring leads. 

Also, feed disqualifying criteria into your automated scoring system to assign negative scores.Sales teams have a deeper understanding of buyer persona due to the direct interaction with sales qualified leads.

The higher the score of the leads, the more likeliness it is to make a purchase.

Step 4: Specify the lowest qualification score  
When setting up lead scoring automation, an essential step is to consider your threshold score, aka the minimum qualification score for a lead.

The minimum qualification score is the sum of all the points a lead gets through performing multiple actions that fall in your customer journey flow. 
Typically, on a scale of 1-100. Prospects with a higher lead score are considered more likely to move down with your sales funnel.
For instance, 80+ is a good score to qualify leads as MQLs.

Be prepared for negative outcomes 
You dialed your prospects with the intent to close the deal, but sometimes you might get a response from the prospect saying;  

“I would like to reconsider.”  
“I’ll get back to you.” (The scary one!) 
“I need to wait until next month.”  

When you get such a response, it might be possible that the prospect is uninterested or has unresolved issues.

How to close a sale on the phone: Step by step process
To create sales opportunities over the phone, you should be well versed in your call opening, answering unexpected questions and objections handling, negotiation, and deal closing statements.
Step 1: Begin your closing sales call in the best way possible 
Introduction plays an important role, whether it is a first or final call.   
Always introduce yourself, mentioning your name, title and agenda of the call.  
And don’t forget to greet your prospect, as it is a kind gesture to begin your call.
Moreover, keep the introduction compelling and concise.   
And after a few exchanges of greetings, you can start a light-hearted conversation.  
But ensure it doesn’t go on unnecessarily long. That might deviate you from the main agenda— closing the deal.   
Click here to start a sales conversation that captures your interest. 
Step 2: Open discussions with the questions 
Once the introduction part is done, now is the time to begin the valuable discussion.   
It would be best if you opened the call discussion with a question.
Here are some questions you can use to open the discussion on a closing call. 

“So, the agenda of our call today is to get you started with our services; where do we stand?”  
“What else can I do to help you finalize the decision?”  
“Is there any query that I still need to answer?”  
“Could you please tell me if there are any further concerns left? So that we can get started with the deal.”  
“What questions do you have that I still need to answer?” 

The question above will reveal your prospect’s intent and also gives details to help you close the deal on the phone. 
Step 3: Handle objections 
If your potential customer doesn’t sound interested in closing the deal and has some resistive objections, you must be prepared to turn the cards in your favor.  
Here are a few of the most common topics of fear and objections that hindered sales:

Pricing/money  
Time  
Need  
Feature and functionality  
Trust   

To handle these resistive points, you must identify and resolve the concern, convincing them to close the deal.

Step 4: Price negotiation 
Buying is incomplete without price negotiation, as every customer wants to save some bucks. 
There might be times when prospects do harsh price negotiation.
And, they might have the mindset that ‘offer me the deal at this price or lose it.’ 
But as a sales rep, you must find a mid-way that makes the prospects happy and meets the company’s guidelines to get saved from losing the sale.  
A smart seller is prepared for price negotiation and knows how to play the game of value propositions to influence customers.

Step 5: Deal closure

Once the negotiation is done and you have a price, two major tasks are left.  

Explaining the onboarding process  
Preparation of the contract, gathering signatures and closing the deal.  

Note: If your prospects mandate procurement or legal reviews, you can review the purchasing process again.  
5 best sales closing phrases that works in every situation 
Various factors come into play when trying to close a call; for instance, are you trying to secure another meeting or get them on board?
So, your agenda for the sales calls should be crystal clear, as this will help you navigate your responses in the right direction. 
Let’s learn the 5 best ways to close a sales call. 

1. When in doubt, close with a question  
Whenever you are stuck on a call and don’t know how to close it without seeming awkward, always go for a question.
It will get a response from your prospect, and you’ll be able to finish the conversation subtly.   
You could ask them for the next appointment, or if you’ve already nurtured the prospect, you could question whether they’d be interested in your free demo.
Closing calls with questions helps you determine the true thoughts of your prospects and enables you to make the right decision to pursue them further.  
Below are a few examples of closing a call with a question:

“That sounds perfect! Shall we set up a date for a free demo so you can understand the product features?”  
“I hope I have clarified everything about the company. However, is there anything you’d like to know more about?”  
“Now that you’ve looked at our product’s features, do you think it takes care of your pain points?  
“I understand your concern; how about we set up a meeting with the company’s product manager so you can resolve your queries?”  

If your prospect still has queries or specific concerns, you need to listen proactively to guide the prospect to the next stage in your sales pipeline.  
Question-based close enables you to qualify the leads based on their level of interest in your product or service.  
2. Closing with a sense of urgency
Your prospect might seem interested in your product or service, but are they ready to close a deal over the phone?
Unnecessary delay in the sales pipeline is time-consuming and refrains you from focusing on the right prospects that might be more interested in making the purchase.  
If your prospect is clear on your value proposition, you can enhance the chance of the deal closing with a time-sensitive statement closing phrase.
Here are the best ways to do it:   

“We have an exclusive offer for our new customers that will be valid until Thursday. So, if you’re interested in grabbing our offer, let’s finalize the deal, and we can move further.”  
“We only have three spots left for this quarter, and five people have already shown their interest, so kindly let me know your decision at the earliest.  
“Every customer that signs up with us this weekend will receive priority on upcoming updates. So, kindly let me know your final decision.”  

3. Last-minute sign-up bonus to seal the deal  
It’s human psychology to ask for special discounts whenever we purchase.
Likewise, your prospect might ask for a discount or free extended subscription, so you should be ready with the right answers.
Before you get on a sales call, you must determine what kind of last-minute offer or discount you’d provide your prospect to motivate them to purchase.
This way, you won’t get confused when the prospect makes a demand.  
Examples of closing a sales call by offering special discounts: 

“Okay, on top of the new sign-up discount I offered to you, I can also add one month of free subscription to your purchase if you sign-up today.”  
“So, hear me out! I am offering you an extra 15% discount on my previous offer if you sign-up by tomorrow.”  
“I noticed that your requirements included purchasing a few add-ons, so let me offer you those as a sign-up bonus if you purchase today.”  

Prospects are often undecisive during the early stages, so offering extra benefits helps win a deal over the phone.
However, ensure you don’t give away your offer early on; negotiate first and then persuade the prospect with your enticing offer.  
4. Offer alternative options   
A product or service might not work for different types of prospects.
Sometimes, your prospect might seem uninterested or confused with your value proposition.
In such a scenario, offering alternatives is best to retain the prospect and convert them into long-lasting customers.
For example, your main product might not interest your prospect, but your other product might!  
See how to close a sales call by offering alternative deals: 

“I understand this product might not be the perfect fit for your company, so I’m proposing a better and more effective alternative – our second-best software that meets your requirements.”  
“If you aren’t sure about my current offer, we also have various other services that you can look at. So, you can only select the package with basic features, and later, you’ll have the option to upgrade as well.”  

5. Highlight your value proposition  
One of the perfect ways of closing a sales call is by highlighting the key points of your offering.
However, you must remember that you won’t close the deal on every sales call, but you can say something that lets your prospect rethink you.
So, by simply highlighting the value proposition of your product and services, you can impact your prospect’s mind to consider you.
Here’s an example that shows how to highlight the value proposition at the end of your sales call:

“So, you’re getting a 1-year contract at a discounted price, which includes 24-hour customer support, free downloadable resources from our extensive library and free onboarding.”   

A quick recap is sufficient to remind your prospect how your company can benefit them in various aspects, encouraging them to close the deal early.
Conclusion 
Closing a sales call can be a tense experience if you aren’t prepared. But, if you are, then the process is quite seamless. 
So, just a quick recall on how to close a sales call efficiently:
Ensure you know your value proposition, unique features & benefits. 
Spend time to build rapport, identify your prospect’s pain points, and present a solution.
And, even if you don’t close the deal in the first place, it’s important to stay persistent and build a good relationship with the prospect.
Moreover, it requires multiple follow-ups for sales closing, so having the right tool by your side streamlines your sales communications.

{"prompt": "How to build a strong sales pipeline for consulting firms?", "completion": "Key TakeawaysModern consulting businesses should have a strong marketing engine to build a solid sales pipeline.Strong sales pipeline results in increased conversions, better customer relationships, and organized processes for pipeline management.The primary steps to building an ideal sales pipeline involve generating leads effectively, prioritizing them, and qualification by the sales reps.
According to a statistic, only 27% of the leads get closed. That means you need constant new prospects to close more deals. 
To accomplish that, your marketing team needs to set up its lead generation engine, and your sales team must constantly qualify leads to build a solid foundation. 
In order to do that, the marketing team must constantly come up with new leads, qualify them, and send them across the sales team to make the pipeline rich. 
I’m writing this article from a slightly different perspective. I believe modern consulting businesses should have a strong marketing engine to build a solid sales pipeline.  
So, let’s dive right in. 
How to build a strong sales pipeline for your consulting business? 
Building your ideal sales pipeline consists of 4 key steps:

Keep the marketing lead generation engine running 
Qualify leads for MQL 
Qualification by the sales team 
Create a meaningful sales pipeline 

Step 1: Keep the marketing lead generation engine running 
Every successful sales conversion begins with collecting the leads, qualifying them for marketing, and submitting them to the salespeople.  
To get things in motion, marketers must take care of the basics: 

Identify your target audience 
Define the kind of content they would appreciate 
Plan a content execution strategy 
Distribute content meaningfully 
Collect leads through forms and newsletter signups 

1. Identify your target audience 
Building Ideal Customer Personas (ICPs) is the first step toward your digital marketing strategy and content creation.  
Start by identifying your target client.  
Research the critical decision-makers and power players capable of making the purchase decision. 
Segment and build a detailed audience list based on demographics, purchase intent, behaviors, and the goals they’d want to accomplish in the future by partnering with you and utilizing your services. 
Here’s an example of ICP for a consultancy that provides marketing services to SaaS platforms.

2. Define the kind of content they would appreciate 
Every marketing department has to create content to generate leads. 
Generally, for consulting, informative blogs, research reports, and whitepapers are more appropriate for your audience.  
You can write more content that includes problem diagnosis, strategy implementation, market research reports, or financial planning.
These are sure to help your audience and resonate with them. 
For instance, Animalz – a content marketing consulting company, writes thought leadership topics like these and gained attention from their target audience.

People find podcasts more entertaining, as they can enjoy them on the go, on their own time. 
Look at McKinsey – A global management consultancy, and the topics they cover in their podcast: 

3. Prepare a content execution plan 
Before creating content, you need a solid content plan, and Cluster Approach is the best option right now.  
In simple words, a cluster is a process of writing multiple child topics to gain authority over a parent topic.  
For example: 
Parent Topic: Consulting services for SaaS   
Child Topic: How much does a consulting charge to a SaaS business? 
It depends on the level of depth of a subject.
Here’s an example of a parent topic, “Business Strategy Consulting.” Look at the child topics based on the funnel stage: 
Top of the Funnel Middle of the Funnel Bottom of the Funnel What is business strategy consulting? Best business strategy consulting firms in New York Business strategy consulting for small business Types of business strategy consulting Marketing business strategy consulting Business strategy consulting for finance businesses  Sales business strategy consulting A landing page on Business Service Consultancy 
4. Distribute your published content 
Now that you’ve created your cluster topics and suitable content around them, you must tell the world.  
More specifically, it would help to let your desired audience know that you’ve published content and what it’s about.  
There are several ways to tell your audience about your published content. 
Post on social media and groups: Create posts about the problems and solutions your audience seeks.
Post them on social media platforms like Facebook, LinkedIn, and community groups to help increase your brand identity.
Associating links with social media posts can give you more traffic as well. 
Email marketing: Send a glimpse of new content to your subscribers. It’s a great way to talk to your audience and keep them engaged. 
Aside from blogs, send the latest industry updates, newsletters, or other weekly tips related to your audiences’ challenges.
It will resonate with them and keep you on top of their mind as an industry expert. 
Publish content on third-party channels like Medium: Medium is a great place to publish blogs and articles apart from your website.
With over 100 million monthly active users, Medium can deliver quality traffic.
Influencer marketing: Partner with influencers in your industry and leverage their influence to target a vast audience.
It will help establish you as a credible source in the eyes of their followers. 
YouTube and podcasts: As mentioned earlier, channels like video and podcast marketing are other super advantageous ways to speak to your audience.   
5. Collect leads through Forms and Newsletter signups 
Remember, the marketing team’s goal is to generate sales leads and bring more money to the table.
The goal of all the educational content should be to bring visitors down the funnel to your service pages (i.e., landing pages).
Your service pages (or money pages) aim to tell visitors about your brand, the value you provide, and the benefits you can bring through your offerings.
For instance, Rapidops – one of the finest digital transformation companies in the world, shows their approach on their service page like this: 

Contact forms and newsletter forms will help you accomplish that.   
Insert fields relevant to your business needs, keep the form simple and short, and use clear labels for each field.
A simple, clearly labeled form allows visitors to fill it out quickly and not lose interest.  
Here, if your CRM software offers web form creation, it’s easier for you to bring all the leads directly into the system for further steps. 
Step 2: Qualify leads for MQL  
You have successfully generated leads and stored them in your CRM. But what’s next?  
You need to qualify the leads you’ve collected and then forward them to the sales, so they can put efforts in the right direction.  
Lead Scoring is an effective way to qualify leads as per your ICP. It assigns a score to your leads based on ideal client traits, demographics, and interests.   
Lead scoring answers a basic question: Does a lead have the potential to become an ideal client for your firm?
The more a lead resonates with your ICP, the higher the score.   
There are many lead scoring models in the market, and it is up to you to choose from and implement them in your lead-scoring process.

Step 3: Qualification by the members of the sales
Once the marketing team scores and assigns leads to salespeople, they have their qualifications.
This is where they contact leads to collect valuable information by asking business-specific questions to understand whether they are a good match.
Such qualifications mainly occur on sales calls.
I’ll not take up your time on these questions, but if you want to read more about it, I’ve plugged in an excellent resource below.

Step 4: Create a meaningful sales pipeline 
This is the most critical aspect, but many businesses build random pipelines.
It is ideal for making a sales pipeline that matches your sales process or aligns with the goals because it will visually represent the ongoing sales process.
To make the correct sales pipeline, you need answers to these questions: 

What is the standardized sales process that your business follows?  
How many stages do you need?  
What’s the importance of each stage for you? 

You can quickly turn your sales process into a pipeline if you have answers to these simple questions. Any modern CRM can help you with it.
Let’s assume that you run an IT consulting. Here’s a typical example of how a sales pipeline would look like.

If you want to learn more about the stages of sales pipelines, I’ve added an FAQ at the bottom of the article.
So, there you go; if your lead gen engine is working, and you constantly push qualified leads forward, you’ll have a healthy sales pipeline for your consulting.
3 tips for maintaining a healthy sales pipeline 
Congratulations, you’ve built a strong pipeline for your salespeople to follow.
However, maintaining a constant lead gen and nurturing flow is another matter. Here are some fantastic tips for maintaining a sales pipeline.
1. Monitor, analyze, and update the pipeline on a weekly basis  
Check the sales pipeline weekly to determine the number of qualified leads and how many conversions have occurred.
In addition, it will estimate the pipeline’s performance, allowing you to make additional changes when required.  
While updating the pipeline, remove a potential poor-performing deal or a bad one to save time and effort on that lead.  
Analyze any leads that are dropping off and adjust your sales process accordingly. 
2. Maintain regular relationships with your leads  
It is essential to regularly keep in touch with your leads to build relationships and keep your consulting on top of their minds.  
Since only some leads are ready to purchase, establishing a relationship is essential.  
Send personalized emails and informative newsletters every week to keep them entertained.

Doing so rather than just promoting your services will establish your business as a trusted consultant. 
Conclusion

{"prompt": "ANUM sales qualification: All you need to know!", "completion": "Key Takeaways22% of sales reps reported qualification for sales as the most arduous task.The ANUM sales framework lets you easily qualify based on authority, need, urgency, and money.You can set your qualification process on automation with a chatbot.
According to a study, 22% of sales reps reported sales qualification as the most challenging part of their sales process.  
Maybe those still need to introduce a sales lead qualification framework!  
Various sales methodologies can help you qualify the actual buyers. And today, we are discussing one of the most effective sales frameworks- ANUM.
Moreover, you can set your qualification process on autopilot.
So, let’s find all the nitty-gritty of the ANUM framework.
What is the ANUM sales qualification framework? 
Ken Krogue develops the ANUM framework. It is a lead qualification framework that takes a customer-centric approach and helps sales reps identify sales opportunities.  
It is a restructured version of the BANT framework where authority is prioritized over budget.  
Prospecting isn’t easy. Reps invest a lot of effort and time in contacting the right audience.  
In such a scenario, realizing that you reached out to an irrelevant prospect is devastating. 
ANUM is a practical framework as it qualifies based on whether they have decision-making powers or not.
Also, beginning your sales pitch focusing on a budget can be daunting. Here’s why the ANUM framework seems effective, as it considers money criteria later.
Moreover, this framework helps reps save time and effort by deciding whether they are dealing with the right prospects or need to look for the correct ones.   
Let’s understand each qualification criterion of ANUM.
The complete process of the ANUM qualification framework

1. Authority  
You just can’t afford to work on a lead that has no power to make the purchasing decision.
This is why the ANUM framework prioritizes authority. It lets you discover whether you are pitching your winning script to the decision-maker or not. 
But who is/are the potential decision-makers?  
Well- it depends.  
There is no perfect definition of the decision-maker. It is purely subjective to the company and its organizational structure.
At some companies, it may be a CFO or a departmental head; in some processes, there may be a group of people who need to be involved throughout the process, and so on.
The technique is to ask the right qualifying question to the MQLs to discover whether they have the decision-making authority or not.
To understand the authority of a prospect to make the purchase decision, you should ask the questions mentioned below:

Can you help me know your company’s buying process, especially with purchasing a product or service like ours? 
Is there anyone else from your team that needs to be included in this conversation? 
How are purchasing decisions typically made in your organization for products/services like ours?
Who is responsible for making the final purchase decision? 
Can you include the (decision maker) in our call? 
Can you help me with the coordinates of (the decision maker) to contact them directly? 

What if you discover that the lead you’re communicating with for sales isn’t the decision-maker? 
Well, you shouldn’t cut off the lead who isn’t the decision-maker, as they can serve as a bridge to reach the person concerned.  
2. Need  
Once you’ve tapped the decision-maker, you must understand their requirements and expectations from a brand like yours.  
Understanding their pain points and taking the conversation in the right direction is vital.
At this stage, you should be aware of their role and responsibilities. This helps you to offer a tailored solution to them. 
Identifying customers’ needs would help you offer a consultive sales approach that boosts the probability of deal conversion. 
Nearly 53% of sales representatives believe the consultative selling approach makes their sales process more efficient. 
As this method considers having a consultation session with the potential buyer that caters to their requirement.
Below are the questions you can ask the lead to understand their needs: 

What’s the key problem your company/ team/ department faces? 
What’s the source of this key problem? 
What’s the goal your team/company aims at achieving? 
Why hasn’t it been addressed before? 
What would be the ideal solution for this problem?  

3. Urgency 
At this stage, you must determine the importance and extremity of your prospect’s purchase plan.
This phase is even denoted as priority and timing in some other frameworks like (BANT, FAINT, CHAMP, etc.)  
This stage evaluates how urgently your prospect requires the solution to their problem.  
However, there is an urgency in an ideal situation at this stage since you already know the prospects are facing problems and need a solution.
So, here’s how you can even directly discover these factors by asking a question like:

What’s the timeframe for getting the problem fixed? 
How long can you wait to get the problem solved? 
Where does this solution stand on your priority list? 
How important is it to get this solution in place? 

Also, you can even discover the urgency of the purchase by getting to know the company’s general news, like its structural changes, mergers, acquisition, etc.
4. Money 
The above qualification will help you understand who you are selling to and how to pitch your product as the solution to their problem. 
But you must qualify your prospect for the most important stage- budget.  
Though self-explanatory, the budget takes a backseat when you communicate with the right person and offer them the required solution.  
The businesses have a budget range per the market prices, so if you can convince your prospects that your solution is a game-changer, they will probably be flexible about it. 
Through the below qualifying questions, you provide certainty about their budget: 

Do you have a budget for this solution? 
How much are you willing to spend on an accurate solution?  
Would you mind spending higher than you’re planned budget on this solution? 
Is there anything else you’re currently allocating the budget on? 

Let’s find out how you can implement ANUM to qualify leads for sales.  
An example of the ANUM qualification framework
This example will help you understand how to leverage ANUM for qualification.

Wrapping up 
ANUM sales framework is a smart sales methodology that helps to qualify the prospect.
It stands for ANUM (authority, need, urgency, money).
If authority is something you aim to qualify for initially, go for the ANUM qualification framework.
Moreover, the sales team can boost their lead qualification process by automatically prioritizing qualified leads and rejecting unqualified leads with a smart automation platform."}
{"prompt": "MQL Vs. SQL Vs. PQL: What’s the difference?", "completion": "Key TakeawaysMarketing qualified leads (MQLs) are those potential customers who interacted with your brands and showed interest in your product/services.A sales-qualified lead is a prospect that has moved from MQL to sales accepted lead and is now interested in a sales conversation to make a purchase.Product qualified leads (PQLs) are the ones that have used or are currently using your product/service and indicating an upgrade in some manner.
21% of salespeople and marketers are unsatisfied with their current lead qualification process.    
Maybe we need to understand the qualification process truly from the core.    
There are three big qualification stages as per teams – MQL, SQL, and PQL (They all have different qualifying grounds).  
This blog covers the main differences between MQLs, PQLs, and SQLs also how you can minimize your sales and marketing efforts with automation.
What is a marketing qualified lead?  
Marketing qualified leads (MQLs) are potential prospects that have interacted with your brand’s marketing activities somewhere at some point.  
Such interactions reflect their interest in your product/services.   
For example, you are a SaaS-based company, and a few web visitors sign up for your product webinar on your website. Then, these are marketing-qualified leads for you.  
There are various factors based on which marketing teams create personas to define their ideal customer profile. These factors may include age, gender, demographics, etc.  
Apart from this, MQLs are qualified based on engagement activities such as Live Chat/chatbot interaction on the website, web page visits, Web Form sign up for free downloadable resources, etc. 
The top behavioral attributes to create a qualification strategy for MQLs are:  
What is a product qualified lead?  
Product qualified leads (PQLs) are those prospects who’ve experienced your product’s functioning with a freemium service.   
This is the stage where your prospects are in the moment to begin understanding your product/services from its functioning ability.  
Also, they are at the stage to provide you with valuable feedback to improve the product in terms of user experience or anything more.  
For a lead to be a PQL, it must have used the product in real, so if a lead has just signed up for a free trial or enrolled for a freemium service, it wouldn’t be considered PQL.    
PQL is a qualification stage for B2B companies that work on the freemium model.   
Their purchase intent is purely based on how well your product has proven as a solution to them.    
Every company has its criteria for PQL that mainly decide at which stage of the buying cycle lead will fall.    
Below are some behavioral attributes to create a PQL qualification strategy. 

What is a sales qualified lead? 
A sales qualified lead is a potential customer that has moved from MQL to sales accepted lead and is now interested in a sales conversation to make a purchase.  
Sales qualified leads (SQLs) are highly interested in the purchase, express ample interest through their response, and are willing to listen to discuss the budgeting, benefits, and more.   
Every company has its qualifying criteria, but a lead to be an SQL must have shown enough intent to buy your product/services.   
Typically, SQLs are progressed from MQLs or PQLs (in the case of B2B).   
MQL Vs SQL Vs PQL: How do they differ?  
Below table will help you get deeper insights into MQL vs SQL, PQL vs MQL and PQL vs SQL.
It will give you a clear picture of each lead’s stage of the customer’s journey, intent, and extent of interest in becoming a paying customer. 
Parameters MQLs PQLs SQLs When are they tagged? MQLs are tagged when they consume your brand’s marketing content resource.    PQLs are tagged when they become unpaid users of your brand’s product/services. SQLs are tagged when they express a deep interest in getting into a deal-closing conversation.  What is their level of interest? Open to the idea of sales Open to knowing the value proposition Open for the sales pitch and deal closing Are they engaged in marketing activities?  Engaged Little  No Are they using your product/services?  No Fully Showed interest in the direction To whom with they communicate with?  Marketing people IT support and salespeople Salespeople At which stage of the customer journey do they lie?  Awareness Consideration and Decision Decision 
From MQL to PQL to SQL: Lead qualification flow in one go!   
To understand the flow of MQLs, SQLs, and PQLs, let’s look at a typical funnel in B2B space.   
See the visual representation of the lead qualification flow of MQLs, SQLs, and PQLs.  

Visitors come to your website through various inbound lead generation and marketing efforts (ads, social media, content, etc.).   
At this very first stage, they will start showing interest in your brand with engagement activities like checking out your website, blogs, and video content, downloading resources, attending webinars, etc.   
Those who meet the set-up lead qualifying criteria for MQLs are considered suitable to go with nurturing.   
Those who don’t meet the criteria are considered not useful or unqualified leads.  
MQLs are further nurtured. This lead nurturing helps to know more about your customers for better sales targeting.   
Salespeople will start interacting and try to qualify these leads with various qualifying questions further.  
So, with every positive response to the qualification questions, these sales accepted leads progressed to SQLs or unqualified leads.  
Moreover, your reps need to engage with these SQLs to convince them to purchase or take the product trial for free.  
Sales qualification is a key step to creating opportunities, and the best way to do it is by following a qualification framework!  
Some MQLs become well aware of your product/services through your aggressive marketing.   
So, they sign up for a free trial and ultimately become users.   
So, once a lead start using your product/services, they fall into a PQL list.   
Often, most PQLs get converted into paying customers themselves.  
Can you automate the lead qualification?  
Yes, you can automate your lead qualification process for MQLs and PQLs.  
But SQLs mostly communicate verbally with the sales reps, so we cannot set any qualification criteria.  
See the table to check on what grounds we qualify MQLs. 
Qualify MQLs Qualify PQLs Based on actions performed  Based on behaviour  
Leads qualify based on their engagement and profile fit. So, once a lead meets the lead score threshold, it will automatically qualify.
Then, your marketing team sends it to the sales team to further qualify with multiple efforts (sales calls, text, and email sequences).
See the step-by-step learning here: 
With a lead scoring tool, you can set your qualification of leads as MQLs on auto-pilot.   
For instance, you can automatically qualify leads based on their email engagement; you can set up email activity triggers (clicked, opened, response, etc.) and assign scores for each condition so that your software automatically takes actions and assigns scores to the lead to qualify.  
Better understand with the visual below: 

Like above, you can set various triggers and conditions for lead scoring actions to qualify leads for your sales team based on what your business demands.  
Automated lead scoring becomes more effective with the support of a CRM, as you can streamline your marketing and sales team efforts from one centralized platform.  
How about a CRM + automation platform that serves…

Bottomline: MQL vs SQL vs PQL
Leads express their intent differently at each stage throughout a customer’s journey.
As we studied in the blog;

MQLs are open to the idea of sales in your product/services.   
SQLs are open to knowing the value proposition. 
PQLs are open for the sales pitch and deal closing. 

And to better understand these stages, study the various comparison like MQL vs SQL, PQL vs SQL or completely like MQL vs SQL vs PQL.
Understanding of quality of leads will move your business in the right direction.
Typically for a B2B company, making a qualification strategy for MQLs, PQLs, and SQLs will shorten their buying cycle.  
For a better sales process, sales and marketing teams must sit together to understand their lead behavior and buyer’s journey.
Moreover, marketing and sales teams both need to understand the flow of leads from the sales funnel for an efficient sales process.
And to ease your marketing and sales efforts, look for a unified customer platform that helps to facilitate your day-to-day tasks easily.

How to set up automated lead scoring? 
Setting up a successful lead scoring could be daunting. But following the flow below will help you prioritize the ideal leads for your business. Let’s begin. 
Step 1: Identify your potential customer behavior  
The first step is to discover what makes a lead a perfect customer.  
So, discover and idealize a road map for your leads as per their behavior.   
For instance, your lead might explore your website and then can sign up for your dedicated product webinar after the website visit. 
After attending the webinar, they might be interested in having a free trial of your product (if you are a SaaS company) or can schedule a meeting with your reps. 
Another route can be a web visitor exploring your web pages, downloading the free resources, answering some qualifying questions with chatbot interaction, and then booking a meeting with your sales representative for further discussion. 
So, you must scan your potential customer’s behavior. It will inform you about your prospects’ actions and help you set your lead scoring attributes. 
Once you’ve got marketing qualified leads, your sales team can further target them to close. 
Step 2: Define criteria for your lead scoring model
You must define various criteria to score leads based on understanding your ideal customer behaviors and buyer persona.   
The criteria include; leads from a specific geographical location or company, job type (incased B2B) etc.   
Here’s the list of the most important qualifying criteria for scoring leads. 

Also, feed disqualifying criteria into your automated scoring system to assign negative scores.Sales teams have a deeper understanding of buyer persona due to the direct interaction with sales qualified leads.
So, to boost your marketing efforts, it would be best for your sales and marketing teams to sit together to discover the qualifying criteria for the scoring models.
Step 3: Assign point values to a specific action performed 
Now that you’ve set up qualifying criteria based on customer engagement behavior, you must specify each action’s score. 
The lead score scale is often 1-100. The more towards a century score indicated the high probabilistic of buying intent.  
The higher the score of the leads, the more likeliness it is to make a purchase. 
You must assign scores to each brand engagement activity. See the example below. 

Businesses build a lead scoring model based on their requirements and ICPs, buyer persona, and behavior attributes to get qualified to begin sales conversations.
You can prioritize and qualify better with the help of a defined lead scoring model. Click to get the most potent scoring models that leading businesses are using.   
Step 4: Specify the lowest qualification score  
When setting up lead scoring automation, an essential step is to consider your threshold score, aka the minimum qualification score for a lead. 
Over time, a lead performs multiple actions that attribute different intents based on which scores are assigned. 
The minimum qualification score is the sum of all the points a lead gets through performing multiple actions that fall in your customer journey flow. 
Typically, on a scale of 1-100. Prospects with a higher lead score are considered more likely to move down with your sales funnel.
For instance, 80+ is a good score to qualify leads as MQLs.   
The easiest way is to track your lead’s journey from awareness to consideration till the decision stage and set up a specific score for each action performed. 
Check out the lead scoring best practices to set up successful automation. 
Step 5: Leverage a lead scoring software
You can manually score leads, but keeping track of score points for thousands of actions to calculate the lead score is not feasible for your marketing team.  
However, introducing lead-scoring software is an intelligent way to set up lead-scoring automation.  
Adopting lead scoring software lets your marketing and sales reps get insight into the worthiness of leads, buying intent, closing opportunities, and many more. 
With all these insights, you can improve your lead nurturing with personalization. 
For instance, if you know your lead has attended a product webinar, your reps can contact them via call or email for feedback to initiate a sales conversation.

Be prepared for negative outcomes 
You dialed your prospects with the intent to close the deal, but sometimes you might get a response from the prospect saying;  

“I would like to reconsider.”  
“I’ll get back to you.” (The scary one!) 
“I need to wait until next month.”  

When you get such a response, it might be possible that the prospect is uninterested or has unresolved issues. 
For example, if your prospect says, “I’d like to rethink about it“, you can come up with a comeback like “I’d love to understand what doubts you still have about the product/service that I can help resolve.”   
And if they react positively, it’s your turn to discover and overcome the roadblock.

How to close a sale on the phone: Step by step process
To create sales opportunities over the phone, you should be well versed in your call opening, answering unexpected questions and objections handling, negotiation, and deal closing statements.
Step 1: Begin your closing sales call in the best way possible 
Introduction plays an important role, whether it is a first or final call.   
Always introduce yourself, mentioning your name, title and agenda of the call.  
And don’t forget to greet your prospect, as it is a kind gesture to begin your call.
Moreover, keep the introduction compelling and concise.   
And after a few exchanges of greetings, you can start a light-hearted conversation.  
But ensure it doesn’t go on unnecessarily long. That might deviate you from the main agenda— closing the deal.   
Click here to start a sales conversation that captures your interest. 
Step 2: Open discussions with the questions 
Once the introduction part is done, now is the time to begin the valuable discussion.   
It would be best if you opened the call discussion with a question.
Here are some questions you can use to open the discussion on a closing call. 

“So, the agenda of our call today is to get you started with our services; where do we stand?”  
“What else can I do to help you finalize the decision?”  
“Is there any query that I still need to answer?”  
“Could you please tell me if there are any further concerns left? So that we can get started with the deal.”  
“What questions do you have that I still need to answer?” 

The question above will reveal your prospect’s intent and also gives details to help you close the deal on the phone. 
Step 3: Handle objections 
If your potential customer doesn’t sound interested in closing the deal and has some resistive objections, you must be prepared to turn the cards in your favor.  
Here are a few of the most common topics of fear and objections that hindered sales:

Pricing/money  
Time  
Need  
Feature and functionality  
Trust   

To handle these resistive points, you must identify and resolve the concern, convincing them to close the deal.

Step 4: Price negotiation 
Buying is incomplete without price negotiation, as every customer wants to save some bucks. 
There might be times when prospects do harsh price negotiation.
And, they might have the mindset that ‘offer me the deal at this price or lose it.’ 
But as a sales rep, you must find a mid-way that makes the prospects happy and meets the company’s guidelines to get saved from losing the sale.  
A smart seller is prepared for price negotiation and knows how to play the game of value propositions to influence customers.
To learn these winsome price negotiation tricks, check here. 
Step 5: Deal closure 
If you’ve cleared out all the objections, you can go with deal closure.  
Once the negotiation is done and you have a price, two major tasks are left.  

Explaining the onboarding process  
Preparation of the contract, gathering signatures and closing the deal.  

Note: If your prospects mandate procurement or legal reviews, you can review the purchasing process again.  
5 best sales closing phrases that works in every situation 
Various factors come into play when trying to close a call; for instance, are you trying to secure another meeting or get them on board?
So, your agenda for the sales calls should be crystal clear, as this will help you navigate your responses in the right direction. 
Let’s learn the 5 best ways to close a sales call. 

1. When in doubt, close with a question  
Whenever you are stuck on a call and don’t know how to close it without seeming awkward, always go for a question.
It will get a response from your prospect, and you’ll be able to finish the conversation subtly.   
You could ask them for the next appointment, or if you’ve already nurtured the prospect, you could question whether they’d be interested in your free demo.
Closing calls with questions helps you determine the true thoughts of your prospects and enables you to make the right decision to pursue them further.  
Below are a few examples of closing a call with a question:

“That sounds perfect! Shall we set up a date for a free demo so you can understand the product features?”  
“I hope I have clarified everything about the company. However, is there anything you’d like to know more about?”  
“Now that you’ve looked at our product’s features, do you think it takes care of your pain points?  
“I understand your concern; how about we set up a meeting with the company’s product manager so you can resolve your queries?”  

If your prospect still has queries or specific concerns, you need to listen proactively to guide the prospect to the next stage in your sales pipeline.  
Question-based close enables you to qualify the leads based on their level of interest in your product or service.  
2. Closing with a sense of urgency
Your prospect might seem interested in your product or service, but are they ready to close a deal over the phone?
Unnecessary delay in the sales pipeline is time-consuming and refrains you from focusing on the right prospects that might be more interested in making the purchase.  
If your prospect is clear on your value proposition, you can enhance the chance of the deal closing with a time-sensitive statement closing phrase.
Here are the best ways to do it:   

“We have an exclusive offer for our new customers that will be valid until Thursday. So, if you’re interested in grabbing our offer, let’s finalize the deal, and we can move further.”  
“We only have three spots left for this quarter, and five people have already shown their interest, so kindly let me know your decision at the earliest.  
“Every customer that signs up with us this weekend will receive priority on upcoming updates. So, kindly let me know your final decision.”  

3. Last-minute sign-up bonus to seal the deal  
It’s human psychology to ask for special discounts whenever we purchase.
Likewise, your prospect might ask for a discount or free extended subscription, so you should be ready with the right answers.
Before you get on a sales call, you must determine what kind of last-minute offer or discount you’d provide your prospect to motivate them to purchase.
This way, you won’t get confused when the prospect makes a demand.  
Examples of closing a sales call by offering special discounts: 

“Okay, on top of the new sign-up discount I offered to you, I can also add one month of free subscription to your purchase if you sign-up today.”  
“So, hear me out! I am offering you an extra 15% discount on my previous offer if you sign-up by tomorrow.”  
“I noticed that your requirements included purchasing a few add-ons, so let me offer you those as a sign-up bonus if you purchase today.”  

Prospects are often undecisive during the early stages, so offering extra benefits helps win a deal over the phone.
However, ensure you don’t give away your offer early on; negotiate first and then persuade the prospect with your enticing offer.  
4. Offer alternative options   
A product or service might not work for different types of prospects.
Sometimes, your prospect might seem uninterested or confused with your value proposition.
In such a scenario, offering alternatives is best to retain the prospect and convert them into long-lasting customers.
For example, your main product might not interest your prospect, but your other product might!  
See how to close a sales call by offering alternative deals: 

“I understand this product might not be the perfect fit for your company, so I’m proposing a better and more effective alternative – our second-best software that meets your requirements.”  
“If you aren’t sure about my current offer, we also have various other services that you can look at. So, you can only select the package with basic features, and later, you’ll have the option to upgrade as well.”  

5. Highlight your value proposition  
One of the perfect ways of closing a sales call is by highlighting the key points of your offering.
However, you must remember that you won’t close the deal on every sales call, but you can say something that lets your prospect rethink you.
So, by simply highlighting the value proposition of your product and services, you can impact your prospect’s mind to consider you.
Here’s an example that shows how to highlight the value proposition at the end of your sales call:

“So, you’re getting a 1-year contract at a discounted price, which includes 24-hour customer support, free downloadable resources from our extensive library and free onboarding.”   

A quick recap is sufficient to remind your prospect how your company can benefit them in various aspects, encouraging them to close the deal early.
Conclusion 
Closing a sales call can be a tense experience if you aren’t prepared. But, if you are, then the process is quite seamless. 
So, just a quick recall on how to close a sales call efficiently:
Ensure you know your value proposition, unique features & benefits. 
Spend time to build rapport, identify your prospect’s pain points, and present a solution.
And, even if you don’t close the deal in the first place, it’s important to stay persistent and build a good relationship with the prospect.
Moreover, it requires multiple follow-ups for sales closing, so having the right tool by your side streamlines your sales communications.
Go for a robust CRM and automation tool that has everything a sales reps need to make their sales process seamless.

This blog talks about how to write an apology email and gives tips for writing a good one with examples. 
Plus, 10 helpful apology email templates for the customer success team.
Let’s start with the definition.
What is an apology email? 
An apology email is a formal message sent to customers after making a mistake.
In a professional workplace, apologies are excellent options for getting a chance to correct your error or can be helpful to prevent losing your precious customers.  
Thinking, what are those many mistakes to send an apology for?
Here’s a list of mistakes.

While some errors are excusable, few might harm your company’s reputation and lower customer loyalty.
So, they demand a formal apology letter/email. 
Let’s see why it is crucial to apologize to your customers.
Why is it important to write an apology email to customers?  
Three reasons why writing an apology emails to customers is essential:  

It saves your brand reputation.  
It protects your customer loyalty from being hampered.  
It preserves you from losing your valuable customers. 

Sometimes, even a tiny mistake, if left unacknowledged, can cause significant loss, like damage to the brand’s reputation or losing a deal.
Your customers might think you need to be more responsible as a brand. 
Now, if you make an effort and send an apology, your customer will feel more valued and consider your actions before making further opinions.  
Remember, it takes time to get a response to your apology letter/email.  
But still, you must send your sincerest apologies if the error is worth apologizing for to save your customer relationship. 
How to write an apology email?  
As per the researchers’ study, you must follow a standard format when writing an apology email to the customer. 
Below is the ideal format that teaches how to apologize to a customer via email:

1. Subject line for an apology email 
The subject line needs to be snappy, clear, and concise.  
To help you with this, here are some apology email subject line samples:

Hey <customer name>! Please accept our apologies. 
An apology from <your name/business name>. 
Hi, <customer name>! We made a mistake. 
Get confused with our last message? 
I am sincerely apologizing. 

You must personalize your subject line with the customer’s name to build a better impact.
2. Humble greeting  
Use the simple format: Dear <Customer name> 
If you are sending an apology, you probably know your customer’s name or other details. If not, use professional terms like “Dear Client” and “Dear Customer” for an individual.
Use “Dear All” and “Dear Team” to address a mass audience. 
Or you can write “Dear” and begin with your opening line. 
3. The body of the email 
Be empathetic, acknowledge well and offer restitution if necessary. 
In Psychology Today, Jeffrey Bernstein, PhD, stated that there are three parts to a meaningful, heartfelt apology.
Elements of a great apology: 

Acknowledge the mistake: You must admit your mistake, as this gesture will positively impact your customers. 
Be empathetic: You must express a sense of emotions that you understand the problems faced by your customers due to the mistake that happened. It connects your readers with you naturally. 
Restitution: Offer compensation at the end of your email to make them feel important. It helps to regain your customers’ trust and build a stronger relationship. 

4. Apology email closing  
This section is where you must talk about restitution and anything that can contribute to correcting your mistake. 
Ensure your closing line is potent to create a good scene and helps you to retrieve your customer relationship. 
See the example below to learn how to end an apology email effectively.

In the above example, the brand has apologized for sending an older email with an expired coupon CODE.  
However, they’ve beautifully corrected their mistake and extended the coupon CODE expiry for one more day. 
5. Professional email signature 
Signatures are integral to any email as it discloses the person to contact if the same mistake happens shortly.
Plus, it helps to humanize your email in case of mass outreach. 
So, it is better to send an apology letter/email from a known representative, like their relationship manager, marketing executive, director etc., that your customers are familiar with. 
Always keep your email signature professional with sign-off such as: 

Kindest regards 
Sincerely 
Thank you

Best customer apology email examples to learn from
Your customer service team can look up these examples from top brands to use in your case effectively. 
1. Personal apology email for missing a meeting 
This type of email is sent when you’ve made a mistake that impacts your customer directly. 
So, by taking all the responsibility for the outcomes, you write your sincere apology email to amend the loss. 
Generally, this type of email is sent by an individual, say a sales rep, customer relationship manager, or a team, e.g., a customer success team. 
For example, a sales rep cancelled a scheduled appointment at the last moment.
Below is an apology made by Zocdoc for not making up for a scheduled meeting. 

Highlights of the Zocdoc’s example:

They addressed the recipient with its name, making it personalized.  
Proposed an offer, “an Amazon gift card,” to turn things in their favor again.  
Motivated the customers to provide feedback to make them feel important.  

Such efforts in the above sample enable the sender to indicate the company’s intention to sustain a better customer relationship. 
2. Managerial apology email 
Sometimes the blunders by a rep demand senior involvement to make a positive impact. 
Apologies sent by a senior manager, leader, or director indicate how much a brand cares about its customers and is ready to fix the issue in every possible manner.    
Outbrain used this trick. 

Highlights of the Outbrain’s example: 

Explained the reason behind the misstep. 
They humbly apologized for the mistake.  
Asked for a second chance to grab the missed opportunity again. 
Provided contact email encouraging them to revert positively. 
Mentioned the name of the marketing director in the signature.

See the excellent example by Forever21. 

Highlights of Forever21’s example:

They creatively made an apology with a “SORRY.”  
Compelling email copy; “our cat ate our website speed.”

Simply with an actionable lead qualification framework!  
There are several lead qualification frameworks, but this blog will tell you the most advanced lead qualification methodology- the FAINT framework.   
Let’s get started! 
What is the FAINT framework?  
FAINT is an advanced sales qualification framework developed by Mike Shultz.   
The acronym FAINT stands for Funds, Authority, Interest, Need, and Timing. 

It qualifies a lead based on its available funds, decision-making authority, interest in your product or service, the need for the solution, and the implementation time frame.   
Let’s learn the FAINT qualification framework in detail. 
A detailed process of the FAINT methodology
There are various frameworks for qualifying prospects, but FAINT differs from others due to its unique qualifying attributes. So, here’s all about FAINT questions and process:
 F- Funds  
The initial criteria to qualify leads using a FAINT is to check their funding capability. In this framework, you consider their funds’ availability over budget.  
The difference between these terms is that your prospect may not have a budget allocated to this solution, but they might have the financial capability to make the purchase.    
You can find out about their funds by referring to their most recent financial statements and published information. 
Also, you can check any relevant financial magazine to get information about their latest sales figures or revenue generated.    
You can ask the following questions to check their purchasing power:   

Have you ever purchased a solution like this before?    
Have you done any business funding in the past?   
What does the company’s operating cash flow look like?    

Asking these questions will help you know the financial position of the company.  
Then, once you see the purchasing capability, it’s time you know the right person to contact. 
A- Authority  
The second qualification attribute is knowing the role contacted leads in decision-making.   
You must try to connect to the decision-maker in the first place rather than the one who’ll stretch the process.    
However, if you’re connected with someone who isn’t the decision maker or hasn’t the authority to take the final call, then you should get help from them to get in touch with the right person.  
You can ask the following questions to check if they have the authority to make the final call:   

Who all are part of the decision-making?    
What other purchase decisions have you taken in the past for the company?   
Who is responsible for making the final call?
What does the decision-making process look like in your company?   

These questions can help you discover the prospect’s authority and inform you about other important people to include in the discussions.    
The third attribute to qualify the lead is their interest in your offerings. 
I- Interest 
Once you know that your prospect has funding capability and authority, it’s time you create their interest in your offering.    
The right way to do so- generating need or value for your offering to their business.    
So, when the prospect feels that your product/service is adding value, can solve their issue, or overcome roadblocks, they will quickly get interested in your offerings.    
Hence, you must do that carefully, as it can be a deal maker or the breaker.    
Here are some questions that can help you know if they are interested in your product/service:    

How does this solution look to you?   
What are your impressions of our offer?   
Does implementation of this solution make sense for now?   

These questions will help you discover their interest in your product.   
The next qualifier is to see if they see your product as needed.  
N- Need 
At this part of the qualification, you need to turn your product into a need for your prospect.   
The FAINT methodology says that leads will only be needy of your product if they know the value it adds towards the growth.    
Following the FAINT qualification strategy, you can be more focused on experimenting with ways to generate interest/need for your product/services in the eyes of your prospects.  
At this qualification stage, you can create opportunities to place your product as a “must-have” than a “nice-to-have” product.  
And this makes the FAINT different from other qualification frameworks.    
Here are questions that you can ask at this stage of qualification.   

What problem does this product solve?   
What led you to search for this solution?   
How crucial is it to get this solution in place?   

These questions will help you discover the need for your offering to them.   
Lastly, timing is considered a qualifying attribute.  
T- Timing 
Timing is always a critical qualifying attribute to move ahead with your sales process.  
So, at this stage, you need to push the prospective to select a time if they don’t have one.   
This way, you also discover the urgency of your prospect’s purchase.   
You can do so by asking them questions like:   

What’s your timeframe for getting this solution implemented?   
When’s the latest you’d like to make a decision?   
By when are you expecting to get the solution for this?   

The above questions will help you discover their timeframe.   
That’s all about the FAINT qualification methodology. Now, let’s look at an example to understand this framework better. 
A fantastic example of the FAINT qualification framework  
Here’s an example of how you can qualify a lead in the initial conversation using the FAINT qualification methodology: 
John(sales rep)- Hello, this is John from “The Design company.” Am I speaking with Mr Ron, the marketing head of “ABC Bank?” 
Ron(prospect)- Yes. What is this call-in regard to? 
John- This is regarding the form you filled out on our website. I am checking your requirement to serve you better. What exactly are you looking for? 
Ron- Yes, we are looking for UX/UI designs for our mobile banking app.  
John- Sure, can you tell me if you’ve had any services like this before? 
Ron- Yes. We’ve revamped our app once, but to walk with the latest trends, we’re looking forward to doing the same.  
John- Get it. Before we move ahead, please let me know who will be a part of this decision-making process.   
Ron- It would be me and some of my subordinates.  
John- Alright, can you help me with their coordinates, so I can include them in our discussions too?  
Ron- Sure. I’ll text you after the call.  
John- Perfect. I am glad you look at us as a capable solution provider. However, what impressions about our solution attract you the most?  
Ron- It’s the quality of your work. We’ve seen some of your projects from our close industry friends who have experienced your work. And this made us contact you. 
John- Glad to hear that. We’ll deliver our best to you. Further, how crucial is it to get the revamping of the app?   
Ron- It is significant for us at this point.   
John- Understand. And how soon do you want to implement this?  
Ron- We want to finish this by the end of this quarter. 
John- Noted. Can we connect this Thursday for the demo call of our services? 
Ron- Sure. 11:00 AM looks good to me. I’ll share my colleagues’ coordinates, so please send them the invite as well. 
John- Okay, I will do it. It was a pleasure talking with you. I look forward to a fruitful session. 
Ron- Same here, thank you.  
Hope this example was helpful. 
Let’s now look at how the FAINT sales framework differs from BANT.
How does the FAINT differ from the BANT framework? 
BANT sales framework qualifies a lead on the budget, authority, need, and timeframe attributes. On the other hand, the FAINT qualifies a lead on the funds, authority, interest, need, and timeframe.  
There are two specific differences between BANT and FAINT methodology. Let’s understand what they are. 
1. FAINT considers funds over budget 
BANT considers a prospect’s budget, and FAINT considers a prospect’s funds.  
This means the FAINT qualification strategy believes even if the prospect doesn’t have the budget allotted, they can still buy the product/service if they are financially doing well.   
2. FAINT considers interest along with the need  
In the FAINT, creating the lead’s interest in the product is essential before creating its need.   
Once a lead gets interested in your brand, it would be easy to create a need around it.    
You can nurture them timely to convince them your brand is the one-stop solution to their challenges.   
Let’s look at how automation adds value to the FAINT qualification process. 
How to leverage the FAINT framework using automation? 
Automation has become an integral part of today’s sales lead qualification process.   
And while you’re using the FAINT, integrating it with an automated qualification tool like Chatbot can be a game changer.   
A Chatbot can be a powerful tool to enable automation in your qualification strategy as you can easily integrate with the FAINT.  
This means you can set up your Chatbot with certain qualifying questions based on the FAINT qualification framework to qualify web visitors via communication.  
You can easily qualify leads by asking why they visit your site, their funding potential and their authority.  
Have your noticed?  
You can already get qualified leads for the initial two criteria without any support from a dedicated employee.  
It’s done by asking critical questions during the initial qualification.  This will help your sales reps in creating a better sales pitch during their various types of sales calls.
After receiving these details, the Chatbot is set to ask to share a meeting link to book a consultation for a further sales conversation.
So, with a smart chatbot, you automate…  

Lead generation

It streamlines your process and ensures that you move ahead with leads with a high potential of becoming paying customers.   
If you’re a business looking for interested clients with better funds apart from other aspects of sales qualification, then this is the framework you need.

{"prompt": "10 Sales objectives to crush your quotas [with examples]", "completion": "Key TakeawaysSales objectives support achieving your overall sales target.Sales objectives are long-term goals that are set to align the entire sales team towards pushing the company forward.Trust the SMART framework to set good sales objectives.
Often, sales teams measure their performances and success by looking at their monthly quotas, average sales value, churn, ROI, and similar metrics.
But what if they don’t know what exactly they are working to achieve?
That’s where the need for having sales objectives comes into play.
And this blog is here to share 10 sales objectives examples you must explore!
But first, let’s know what “sales objectives” means.
What are sales objectives? 
Sales objectives are long-term goals that are set to align the entire sales team towards pushing the company forward.  
They act as a blueprint to define a sales team’ next steps to accomplish individual and departmental sales targets.
But sales objectives are not the same as KPIs.  
They are the overarching themes that define the metrics that depict the success of sales. 
Setting sales goals for driving results out of your reps’ actions is critical.  
Firstly, let’s discover the common challenges that sales professionals face while setting sales objectives. 
Common challenges in setting sales objectives 
The majority of the sales reps spend most of their time on non-revenue-generating activities.  
The high percentage is often due to unrealistic goals, a rise in menial tasks, and other underlying challenges that stop companies from setting frictionless sales objectives. 
Some of the major sales challenges that sales professionals face are:

Managing volumes of data and segregating them into use cases 
The inability to manage data and business insights across multiple departments 
The absence of the company’s long-term or short-term vision 
Inadequate knowledge in accessing technology or tools to derive real-time insights 
Measuring success by defining shared metrics 

Sales managers need to define clear sales objectives with a strategy to achieve the desired sales goal.
This way, it would be easier to overcome the majority of challenges coming their way.
So, let’s find the right way to set sales objectives.
How to use sales objectives effectively?  
Most businesses use SMART sales goals to execute sales plans.  

The SMART framework is effective as it covers the main attributes to create actionable sales objectives.

S – Specific for any task/actions performed by the sales team  
M – Measurable to assess the success and failure 
A – Attainable on realistic grounds based on the resources available  
R – Relevant to align with your business, team, and individual goals 
T – Time-bound to achieve the particular goal timely which boosts your team’s productivity 

Let’s understand with a sales objective example based on a measurable and time-bound mindset.
Suppose your sales team aims to improve customer retention by 20% over the next year.
The SMART goal will help you define that the team must retain at least 5% of customers quarterly.
10 key sales objectives examples you must use

These 10 sales objectives examples will help you to improve your team’s overall performance. So, let’s dive in. 
1. Increase win rate 
Win rate is a top sales performance metric that refers to the percentage of prospects who became customers divided by the number of pending deals.  
This metric is a clear indicator of the success of your sales funnel because a higher win rate suggests higher revenue. 
Sales objective example:  
Improve win rates by 10% by the end of the following two quarters. 
Tips to achieve this sales objective:  

Improve your qualification process to get qualified leads for sales 
Track sales activities of your sales reps over a period to remove bottlenecks
Leverage sales intelligence to identify bottlenecks and opportunities  
Set up regular optimization of your sales process 
Provide sales training proactively for upskilling and reskilling  
Gather feedback from the sales team and customers to get a complete picture  

2. Reduce customer acquisition costs (CAC) 
You can save more resources for your business expansions by lowering your customer acquisition cost (CAC).
For example, you will have more resources for campaign spending and the tools available to marketing, advertising and sales teams.  
Sales objective example:  
Cut down CAC by 15% in the next quarter by employing other highly skilled, less expensive methods to win customers, such as ensuring the product or service matches the customer’s current situation. 
Tips to achieve this sales objective:  

Analyze your current customer acquisition cost to discover key channel spends  
Calculate the ROI from each channel and identify your best sources 
Identify which channel drives high-quality (sales-worthy) leads  
Re-evaluate audience targeting and buyer persona to optimize the strategy
Work on your pricing strategy to improve in the possible way 
Keep track and use analytics to measure the success   

3. Lower churn rate  
Customer churn rate measures the number of existing customers or subscribers cancelling or not renewing your services.
Also, it indicates how easily offers made by your competitors can sway your audience.
By focusing on this sales objective, you can secure your market capture, optimizing the return on your customer acquisition spend.  
Sales objective example:  
Slash customer churn rate by 10% by the end of the month and achieve this by offering attractive customer incentives or discounts. 
Tips to achieve this sales objective:  

Deep dive into sales reports to identify the point of drop-off 
Proactively address customer concerns 
Conduct closed surveys to seek customer feedback  
Train your teams effectively to offer better customer service 
Introduce a Chatbot to assist customers 24/7 
Offer post sales follow-up and onboarding support 
Keep a close watch on your competitors

4. Enhance customer lifetime value (CLV) 
Getting more sales from an existing customer is cheaper than acquiring a new one – especially owing to the increasing customer acquisition costs across all channels.  
Therefore, CLV is an important metric for your sales team’s attention.
Sales objective example:  
Increase the average order value and purchase frequency by 10% before the year ends. 
Tips to achieve this sales objective:  

Segment your customers based on interest, intent, preferences  
Focus on setting up upsell and cross-sell campaigns with personalized recommendations 
Offer freebies or free trials to encourage discovery
Build a community of customers to boost loyalty 
Boost your customer engagement strategy with automation 
Run loyalty programs and offer incentives 

5. Improve monthly or annual revenue 
Increased revenue indicates a company’s profitability and competitiveness in the market.  
But no one-size-fits-all method works for generating higher revenue month-on-month or year-over-year.  
This sales objective can involve calculating revenue per sales representative or the entire team. 
Sales objective example:  
Reach our monthly recurring revenue target of 15% more than the previous year. 
Tips to achieve this sales objective:  

Focus on customer retention to increase recurring revenue  
Invest in marketing and advertising to attract new customers
Leverage cold calling and emailing to the fullest  
Keep a close look on sales pipelines to identify opportunities for more sales 
Increase purchase size by upselling products or services to active customers 
Leverage technologies like CRM, marketing automation and analytics to boost revenue-making opportunities
Train sales team on creating a moment for cross and upselling

6. Raise profit margins 
If the revenue objective seems harder to execute, raising profit margins is an easier alternative to boost revenue.  
Profit margins are popular profitability indicators representing profits made by selling more units with higher margins.  
Sales objective example:  
Increase profit margins/units sold by 10% through impactful sales calls by the end of the upcoming quarter.  
Tips to achieve this sales objective:  

Find out what products generate the most profits 
Upsell and cross-sell products to customers 
Emphasize the values that your brand offers towards solving their problems 
Train your reps to overcome sales objections during sales calls

7. Shorten deal closure time/ sales cycle  
A lengthier sales cycle indicates longer time spent closing deals and delayed revenue for your organization.
This can result in prospects exploring more options in the market, resulting in walkaways from deals.
Sales objective example:  
Decrease deal closure time by 20% in the next quarter by pre-qualifying leads and eliminating cold leads early in the sales cycle.  
Tips to achieve this sales objective:  

Build a lead scoring model to prioritize leads  
Leverage lead scoring software to automate your qualification process 
Qualify MQLs for sales with ideal qualifying questions 
Help your sales team personalize their pitches 
Set your mundane tasks on autopilot with workflow automation 

8. Enhance the number of high quality leads 
You can only optimize a sales process when you have the right leads in your pipeline.  
If you target too broad, it may bring in prospects that are too far away from making the purchase.
On the other hand, targeting too narrow may reduce the number of leads your sales team can bring into the pipeline, leading to even lesser closure.
The quality of leads is more important than their quantity.
So, your marketing teams must generate and qualify leads effectively, saving their reps time by providing the hottest leads for sales targeting. 
Sales objective example:  
Increase the number of high-quality leads by 25% with lead scoring. 
Tips to achieve this sales objective:  

Define your ideal customer profile and buyer persona 
Build a lead scoring model to prioritize leads 
Introduce an automatic lead scoring tool for faster and error-free lead qualification  
Set up and follow a sales qualification framework, including all the key qualifying questions  

  

Create your custom model in minutes!Take control of your lead scoring process and create a model that fits your business needs perfectly with marketing automation!Explore Marketing Automation
9. Faster response time  
50% of potential buyers prefer a brand that responds first. 
Customers and leads loathe super long waiting times. Your prospects lose interest in your business if your response rate is low. 
Also, this can adversely impact your brand image in the long run. 
Sales objective example:  
Every sales rep must respond to warm leads and prospects within the three-hour bracket of receiving an inquiry by creating a daily response schedule. 
Tips to achieve this sales objective:   

Introduce a sales CRM to manage your inbound leads and for faster communication 
Set for auto-assigning of leads, so all get an instant attention 
Set up an automated system to give alerts to sales reps when a lead qualifies 
Automate follow-up with Sales Sequence 
Conduct training of reps on time management and communication skills 
Use Mobile CRM as it lets you respond to leads anytime, anywhere 

10. Close more deals 
You must track the number of deals your sales team and individual sales rep closed.
Remember that to achieve this objective, what worked once for you may not fetch the same results again.
So, preparing your reps to win every possible conversation that tends to close the deal would be best.  
Sales objective example:  
Close 20 deals by the end of the first quarter. And individually close three deals by the end of the second quarter using sales best practices. 
Tips to achieve this sales objective:  

Evaluate the performance across your sales objectives to identify roadblocks 
Provide sales enablement training to reps for better customer handling 
Boost your lead generation efforts via omnichannel targeting 
Improve your lead qualification process to get quality leads 
Build a custom sales pipeline to track the opportunity of the deal closing 
Implement a CRM and automation tool to manage and track your entire sales process 

Final thoughts 
Apart from setting actionable sales objectives, ensure you check in on them regularly — weekly or biweekly.
Regular check-ins help your company and teams never lose track or get overwhelmed as new opportunities arise.
Also, celebrate smaller milestones when your sales reps are on the course to accomplish the main objective and keep the momentum going.
As sales leaders, you must guide your team in achieving precise sales goals.
Work towards your best-suited objectives, chase them and measure them to set your teams up for success.

How do chatbots qualify leads? 
Here’s how chatbots qualify leads so you can optimize your strategy and drive better results.  

Step 1: Set sales qualification framework  
When setting these parameters, you need an effective qualification framework relevant to your business.

After selecting the framework, it is time to frame qualifying questions. These questions will help the bot qualify the lead and pass them directly to the sales team.   
You must ask simple yet specific questions that serve the purpose of business.   
Visitors also appreciate answering questions that are minimal in counts and serve concise intention.   
These questions help to understand the motive of visitors to the page. Your bot should have a set of questions like:  

What got you here today?  
What is your objective with [brand name]?  
What do you want to enquire about?  
What’s your budget range?  
How soon do you want to implement this solution?  
Can you help me with your Name and contact coordinates so our team can contact you directly?

{"prompt": "🚀 Salesmate Experience Updates: 11 exciting things happened this March", "completion": "A couple of important additions and improvements this month.  There’s no specific theme to this month’s updates, but we have meaningful changes to Automation Journeys, Chat Journeys, Add-ons, etc.And also, Lead Parsing is here! Long story short, we picked issues based on customer interactions and went with them. Hope you find these updates useful 😊  1. Plan communication sensibly with Sequence Filters Communication wins customers – that’s a fact and we know it. But sometimes, we completely lose track and end up communicating with subscribers/prospects a bit too much!   That’s why Sequence filters are here, so you can find out exactly how many contacts are enrolled in Sequences right now. Or you can find out which Sequence ended last, so you can plan a new campaign for these specific contacts.  In simple words, these filters will help you identify contacts associated with different Sequences with their respective stages, so you can plan your communication in a sensible way. Learn more about Sequence Filters 2. Deeper email insights for contacts using new filters If you are always curious about knowing who opened or replied to an email with a subject, campaign, or template, then our new search feature is for you. No more jumping between multiple contacts to see if they have opened your email or not; simply filter them out and plan your next set of actions.3. Full-proof Sequence communications We have added a new option to send a test email and text before making the Sequence live. Quickly choose a deal or contact to see how personalization fields will appear within your email and how specific contact is going to view it within their inbox. This new option is available under any of the sequence steps, simply click on the Actions buttons and select the “Send Test Email” option from the list. 4. Take personalized outbound messaging to the next level with Contact & Company fields in Chat Journeys It’s much easier to leverage Chat Journeys for highly personalized outbound messaging.  While choosing Audience, you can find all the Contact and Company fields. So now, you can choose a specific audience to show personalized messages, offers, promotions, etc. So, targeting a message to a handful of customers is also possible with Chat Journeys. 5. Associate Tags to Chat Journey conversations for stronger insights Tags are one of the most crucial elements in conversation analysis, especially after the new Tag Reports. And this update will power up the analysis further.   You can associate multiple tags to conversations handled by Chat Journeys. It’s super helpful when you have multiple automation in motion. For example, you’d be able to see the number of conversations the bot handled for Pricing, Customer Support, Feature Requests, etc.  Learn about Tags to Chat Journey 6. Improve outbound messaging with a new Chat Journey trigger Our chat journeys now support a new trigger called “Event”, which broadens the scope of possibilities. Now send a message or show help to the visitor when they interact with your website or App. E.g., Triggering a chat journey is possible when they add or remove a product from the cart, book a meeting, or even submit a form for a case study download.  7. Bring out lead data from your lead source emails automatically Every business relies on multiple sources for quality leads.  The real problem is when some providers share lead information via email. Though these emails are very simple in nature, they come with a big problem! You have to manually create new leads by copy-pasting their names, companies, and locations, into CRM.  A lead parser can simplify this task and save hours of manual data entry for you. We are launching email parsers to automatically bring out lead data from such emails and turn them into Contacts in Salesmate. With Salesmate’s email parsers… 
You can directly assign these leads to a user or a team (round-robin) You can associate Tags that can be amazing filters for sorting You can directly add them to a List for shooting highly personalized campaigns So, no more data entry for these emails, all you have to do is choose from the list of pre-defined providers or set up a custom provider. Don’t worry, the process is quite simple for both.  You can learn more about them in our support article or connect with our customer success team for a quick solution. Right now, we have started with two lead providers – Homepie and IndiaMART. If you want us to add more lead sources, please connect with our support team. We’d be happy to move forward with your request 🙂8.

{"prompt": "What is incremental sales? Definition and formula", "completion": "Key TakeawaysIncremental sales is a metric that helps determine the difference between actual sales you generate during a specific timeframe and the estimated sales you would have generated.Incremental sales is an extremely important metric or KPI for sales managers, sales teams, and the business itself.Incremental sales formula: Incremental sales = Total Sales – Baseline SalesMarketing is all about being memorable to potential customers.By consistently engaging with them and making a good impression, you increase the chances that they will immediately think of your brand when they need a product or service you offer. And the primary objective of putting in marketing efforts is to increase demand and boost revenue.But the only way you can ensure that your efforts are paying off is by measuring the right metric of the campaign. Which is that metric? – Incremental Sales! Indeed many other factors are essential, such as conversion rate, cost per lead, engagement, and more.But incremental sales is a metric that will help evaluate whether your marketing effort is showing results or not.But before we see how you can measure incremental sales, let’s take a quick look at what exactly is incremental sales.What is incremental sales? Incremental sales is a metric that helps determine the difference between actual sales you generate during a specific timeframe and the estimated sales you would have generated.And, because the growth in sales is usually a result of promotional campaigns, it’s also referred to as a sales metric or a KPI (key performance indicator) that helps evaluate marketing effectiveness and performance of campaigns.The two most important things here are baseline sales, which refers to the revenue you generate without marketing efforts. And the second thing is campaigns, which in this context, are the marketing channels you choose to reach your potential customers. So, this includes campaigns such as PPC advertisements, influencer marketing, social media advertisement, influencer marketing, and other such campaigns. Why do you need to measure incremental sales? Measuring incremental sales truly has its perks.It is a KPI that can shape the way your sales numbers grow. And, if the revenue you’ve evaluated after measuring incremental sales is high, the campaign’s performance is good.Whereas, if the numbers are negative, there are areas where improvement could be made.Incremental sales can help identify loopholes in the sales process, enables better allocation of marketing funds, and helps identify shortcomings. As a result, increased profit is achieved.Moreover, keeping track of incremental sales can help better strategize your upcoming promotional campaigns.  How to calculate incremental sales?  The incremental sales formula highlights the growth in sales due to promotional activities during a set timeframe.Let’s learn how to calculate incremental sales to evaluate the success of marketing campaigns.Incremental sales formula: Incremental Sales = Total Sales – Baseline Sales Now, let’s clear out the concepts mentioned in the formula.  Total sales: It is the revenue your business generated during a set timeframe when the marketing campaigns were active.  Baseline sales: Itis the revenue you had projected your business would have generated during a set timeframe without marketing campaigns. Calculating baseline sales can be a little tricky! However, educated guesswork can help make this easier.A common approach is calculating the company’s average annual sales growth (without the marketing promotion).  Now, let’s plug in some real numbers in the formula and take a look at an incremental sales example for a better understanding: Let’s assume total sales for,2021: $170,000 2022: $200,000 As mentioned earlier, let’s roughly take an average of the last three years of average annual sales growth (promotion-free) for baseline sales.2018-2019 = $20,000 2019-2020 = $25,000 2020-2021 = $30,000 Average annual sales growth = $20000 + $25000 + $30000 = $75,000 Average annual sales growth = $75000 ÷ 3 = $25,000 Now as we know the average annual sales growth, can plug that into  Baseline sales for 2022 = $170000 (2021) + $25000 (average annual sales growth) = $145,000 So, the final figure would be: Incremental Sales = $200000 – $145000 = $55,000 Now that we’ve seen how to calculate incremental sales let’s look at the best practices.Best practices for improving incremental sales Here are a few important things you should keep in mind to improve incremental sales: 1. Utilize an efficient CRM for analytics: You’re well aware that keeping track of incremental sales and other important metrics of marketing campaigns isn’t a piece of cake. Instead, it requires a precise evaluation of the metrics.Also, if you don’t already use software to manage sales revenue and other crucial indicators, you might want to start by thinking about a potent CRM like Salesmate.  With interactive sales dashboards and simple analytics, Salesmate makes it extremely easy for businesses to make informed decisions from insightful sales reports.

Upselling and Cross-selling: Offering additional products or services to customers who are already purchasing can significantly improve sales figures.For instance, if someone is purchasing a laptop, there is a high chance that they might need a laptop bag or sleeve as well. So, finding products or services that complement each other can be a great way to ensure that your sales figures keep growing. 3. Choosing relevant KPIs Choosing the relevant KPIs is the second-best practice to improve your incremental sales.Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are various metrics that help you measure the efficiency of your marketing effort. Hence, adopting the correct ones along with incremental sales KPI is essential. Some common KPIs include: 
New sales leads Conversion rate Click-through rate Lead-to-customer ratio, and more.4.

Picking the right marketing channel Another practice to improve incremental sales is to use the right marketing channel.Since various target customers are available on various social media platforms, you must pick the right one to get good results.You can use various marketing channels like: 
Social media marketing Email marketing Search Engine Optimization (SEO) marketing 6. Flexibility in adapting to the latest trends Marketing trends are dynamic, and so should your efforts. When hopping on a new marketing trend, you should be aware of these trends and then have flexible efforts to adopt one.Also, never resist trying new marketing strategies. Have a trial and error method to identify the best marketing campaign.Once you create, test, and analyze a successful marketing strategy, you can also witness substantial growth in your sales. Eventually leading to improved incremental sales.Conclusion Overall, incremental sales is a crucial metric for any business’s growth.Keeping track of the metric will help your business increase revenue as you can constantly optimize your marketing efforts and gain a competitive edge in the market. And strategies like upselling, cross-selling, product bundling, and many more, help ensure that the incremental sales figures keep growing.By implementing the best practices and measuring their effectiveness, businesses can stay ahead of the competition and continue to grow and thrive."}
{"prompt": "Mortgage lead scoring – Do it the right way!", "completion": "Key TakeawaysMortgage lead scoring means qualifying leads based on their interest in a mortgage loan.Multiple factors influence mortgage lead scoring, such as credit score, DTI (Debt-to-Income) ratio, readiness to pay down payment, lead behavior, engagement attributes, etc.Automated lead scoring software can qualify mortgage leads more efficiently and boost conversion.
According to the National Association of Realtors, existing-home sales hit their highest level in 15 years in 2021.  
Wow! It means the mortgage industry is booming, with more and more people looking for housing loans.  
But the concern is the inefficiency of grabbing the potential opportunity! 
This is why only 2-3% of mortgage leads conversion is seen.   
Inefficient mortgage lead scoring kills marketing professionals’ efforts to get quality leads.  
Worry not!  
This blog covers ways to improve your mortgage lead conversion chances. Plus, you’ll learn the secrets of successful mortgage lead scoring.
But firstly, let’s understand why the conversion of mortgage leads is drowning.  
Why are mortgage lead conversions drowning? 
There are a few critical factors leading to a low mortgage lead conversion. Let’s have a look at them. 
1. Rise in buying poor quality leads from vendors
Online advertising drives quick results, and lead vendors leverage these channels to generate leads for other businesses.
Thus, many mortgage lenders aiming to leap to success purchase leads from lead vendors.
Unfortunately, those leads are neither aware of the company’s values nor filtered according to its requirements.  
So, when a sales rep approaches these unqualified leads, there is hardly any chance of gaining the opportunity of conversion. 
2. Inefficient lead scoring process 
Lead scoring is vital to get qualified leads. But most businesses either follow the generalized or wrong lead scoring models, which results in no fruitful outcomes. 
So, with a lack of understanding of an effective lead scoring model, all the efforts are turned into wasted time and resources. 
3. Not using the right software for nurturing leads 
Connecting with the right leads at the right time with the right offer is extremely important.
And, if you don’t have the software that can support your mission, it gets tricky to stay on top of the lead’s mind.
A robust tool like marketing automation software can help you in targeting with personalized campaigns with an attractive offer they can’t resist! 
Also, your leads are getting offers from your competitors, so ensure you should be quick with building relationships. 
So, automate your mundane tasks to be more productive, aka deal closing front.
Skyrocketing success is achievable with an effective lead-scoring model specific to your mortgage business.
So, let’s understand mortgage lead scoring and how it can be a game changer in getting more opportunities with an example.  
Mortgage lead scoring with example in action 
Mortgage lead scoring is a first step towards qualifying leads based on their interest in taking a mortgage loan.  
Here the lead scoring system involves various attributes that indicate prospects’ intent towards taking a home loan. 
Qualifying criteria for effective mortgage lead scoring majorly includes…

Source of leads 
Demographics of the leads 
Details regarding the financial status of the lead shared via the contact form or other communication channels 
Website engagement via Chatbot/Live Chat 
Actions performed on a website like submitting a Web Form, signing up for a newsletter etc. 
Pain points/Challenges of the leads 
Timeframe which they want to secure the financing  

Based on the above details shared by leads during the interaction, they are assigned scores which indicate their quality to become a potential customer. 
Let’s take an example of mortgage lead scoring to have an actual walk-through!   
Mr. John lives in Phoenix, Arizona. He’s searching for a 4-bedroom house and looking for a mortgage lender.
He is a tech firm manager with a good credit score of 700+ and even a proper DTI ratio.  
He talked with his friends and family regarding this. Then, he went on to search the internet for more information.  
Whilst browsing, Mr. John reviewed multiple websites with information about mortgages. 
And he filled out contact forms on websites that seemed relevant to his requirements.
He even went on to download one of the free e-books the website was offering for mortgages.   
Plus, he interacted via Live Chat/Chatbots on a few mortgage lenders’ websites. 
As Mr. John interacted with the website and the business, he fulfilled multiple qualification criteria.  
Such as:  

Interacting with multiple website pages.  
Downloading a free e-book of the mortgage.  
Filling out the contact form with his requirements.  
Having a good credit score.  
Maintaining DTI (Debt-to-Income) ratio.  
Performing multiple activities on your website that expressed his urgency of buying.

Now, for a mortgage company, web visitors like Mr. John, who is engaging in every possible way to initiate the conversation, are considered a hot lead.
So, on such grounds, the lead scoring system of the mortgage company will consider Mr. John a qualified lead.
Hope this was helpful!

The secret to successful mortgage lead scoring 
Most of the mortgage leads qualification depends on the financial stability of the leads. Here is the list of multiple attributes to improve your mortgage lead scoring system fully.   
1. Interaction with the digital fronts of your mortgage business 
If a visitor interacts with your website or social media platforms more than other visitors, the lead is probably intrigued to learn more about your business in the near future.
These are significant behaviors that you can opt to assign point values to those leads.
So, discover the time they spent on each page, which lead magnet they interacted with, no. of web pages explored, email responses, which CTA most spiked their interest, and more.  
2. Strong financial background 
In Web Forms or the chatbot system, you can include questions to discover financial data points like credit score or DTI (Debt-to-Income) ratio. 
With this, you can learn things like whether or not the lead has a credit score of 620+ (which is usually a sweet spot), has a good DTI, and is willing to pay the upfront fees.  
The must-have qualifying criteria for mortgage leads are…   

Credit score  
Annual income   
Source of income   
Debt  

These financial point values will help you discover the lead’s loan repayment capability.   
A prospect with a suitable financially stable background is more likely to consider a risk-free lead for your mortgage business.
3. Loan amount 
Certain factors define the amount of money a borrower can seek for a loan.
Consider the amount as a qualifying aspect for a mortgage lead and ensure to audit their status, like employment background, loan history, and debt, before qualifying them.
4. Property type and location 
Consider the type of property and its location when qualifying leads for mortgage loans. Ensure to assess if there is any dispute or risk associated with the property and the site.
Set up for assigning a negative score to mortgage leads associated with high-risk locations/properties. 
5. Consult loan officers 
You must consult your loan officers and managers to gain insights from their one-on-one interaction with mortgage leads.
Then, build an effective lead scoring model based on their on-the-ground knowledge.
6. More web actions indicate an urgency  
The urgency to take action is also one of the critical qualification factors that businesses can consider when assigning lead scoring criteria.   
It can be derived by evaluating how many actions the lead has performed, like whether the lead has downloaded any free resources or even signed up for a newsletter.
Doing so can assign a high score to the lead most willing to move forward with your business, resulting in better lead qualification.

{"prompt": "All you need to know about SaaS lead scoring!", "completion": "Key Takeaways73% of the leads you receive aren’t sales-ready.SaaS lead scoring can be done in four easy steps. Develop an ICP, define criteria for scoring leads, allot scores to set criteria, and automate the process using a tool.Automating the SaaS lead scoring process can relieve your teams from constantly doing mundane tasks and rather focus on more important things like engaging and nurturing the leads.
According to Belkins, 85% to 90% of leads don’t convert into deals. Now, that’s startling! And that’s why qualifying the leads before declaring them an SQL (sales qualified lead) is important. 
Lead scoring is an inevitable step in the lead qualification process. And since SaaS is all about the speedy functioning of processes, gathering lead data, and improvising customer relationships. It is important to understand the lead-scoring process of this industry.  
So, this blog focuses on providing you with everything you need to know about SaaS lead scoring.
How is SaaS lead scoring different from traditional lead scoring? 
The process of qualifying leads in SaaS is relatively different compared to other industries. And that’s why SaaS lead scoring has dynamic criteria. 
Unlike SaaS lead scoring, which utilizes basic demographic information such as job title or industry, SaaS lead scoring takes into account multiple factors. Here are a few lead scoring factors that are primarily utilized to evaluate prospects: 
Demographic data 
Explicit data: This is the demographic data of the lead. So this includes factors like job title, deal value, company name, age, gender, and more.  
Implicit data: This is the lead’s behavioral data. So this includes factors like time spent on the website, responsiveness to social media ads, newsletter subscriptions, contact form requests, and more. 
Scoring 
SaaS lead scoring now uses algorithms to constantly adjust the scoring system based on previously processed leads. Due to this, the quality of leads that are being qualified constantly gets updated, and the process ensures that the least promising leads aren’t filtered through. 
Personalized scoring 
In contrast to traditional lead scoring, SaaS lead scoring is more personalized. It takes into consideration a prospect’s behavior across multiple digital channels. It’s like having a complete tool to work with rather than just a hammer. 
Automation is possible 
With SaaS lead scoring tool, automation is possible. As a result, a lot of time and resources are saved. So, sales teams and marketers can focus their time on more important tasks. 
Automation also ensures that good leads are scored consistently and more accurately, which can help improve the overall efficiency of the lead qualification process. 
Benefits of SaaS lead scoring 
Lead scoring is paramount in the lead qualification process. This not only helps in qualifying leads accurately but also carries various other benefits mentioned below:  
Lead scoring is one of the most important parts of the lead qualification process. It helps identify and qualify the leads that are most promising for the business. However, this is just one way lead scoring can help. Here are a few more:

1. Alignment of sales and marketing teams 
Lead scoring isn’t a walk in the park! It requires a team effort to execute efficiently.   
Oftentimes, marketing and sales professionals would need to work collaboratively with a common goal and define certain set criteria. This way, they can qualify the most promising leads for the business.  
SaaS lead scoring can help bridge the gap between marketing and sales teams. Alignment of sales and marketing teams can help drive a more optimized lead scoring model.  
It can also ensure that quality leads are passed to the sales teams at the right time, increasing the chances of closing more deals.  Overall, the collaboration of the teams can result in better ROI and increased efficiency in sales efforts.  
2. Better sales forecasting 
Lead scoring plays a vital role in forecasting sales. While you define lead scoring factors and criteria for analyzing sales-ready leads, you learn a lot about the lead.   
You can match the information with your ICP (ideal customer profile) and analyze future sales. This way, the lead who resembles the most with your ICP has a higher chance of sales than the one with less resemblance with your ICP. 
3. Saves time & resources for marketing and sales teams 
The core purpose of implementing lead scoring in the lead qualification process is to qualify the most promising leads that are valuable for the business. Because of this process integration, sales teams spend their time on valuable leads. 
This also means that sales teams can focus on engaging and nurturing potential leads instead of investing time and effort in all the invaluable leads. 
4. Increases conversion rate 
As lead scoring filters the most promising leads, sales professionals can improve personalization and tailor their outreach communication. It also helps them reach out to the leads at the right time, resulting in an overall increased conversion rate. 
These were the significant benefits of SaaS lead scoring.  
Having said that, you would need a SaaS lead scoring model to avail these benefits. So, let’s take a look at how you can develop one:

Steps to develop a SaaS lead scoring model
SaaS lead scoring is pretty straightforward and uncomplicated. With a lead scoring model in place, you can easily move your prospects ahead in the customer journey. Here’s how you can develop a SaaS lead scoring model:

1. Develop an ICP (ideal customer profile) 
An ideal customer profile fundamentally means the description of your ideal customer. This includes multiple factors such as demographics, behavior, and pain points. Having a defined ICP helps businesses to understand a target their most valuable customers.  
Here’s how you can create an ICP: 

Start with alist of your best customers and identify a few similar purchasing patterns between all these customers. And list down a few common factors that you find valuable.  
Afterward, outline their issues by discovering their pain points and understanding how your product plays a solution role. 
Afterward, evaluate the issues they are facing using the products available in the market and identify vital pain points. 
Lastly, document all this information. Boom! Your ideal customer profile is ready!  

Also, don’t forget to create multiple ICPs! Don’t fixate on creating one and sticking to that. Utilize multiple ones and identify the best one that works for your business. 
2. Define criteria for scoring leads 
To be qualified as a lead, each prospect must meet a set criterion. So, as we’re done with ICPs, you must know the common factors and pain points the customers are facing.  
From those insights, define qualification factors that you find are quite important for your business to qualify a prospect to a lead. And a best practice to keep in mind is sorting them from the most important to the least important.  
Moreover, one more thing to keep in mind is that keep updating the qualification factors from time to time, as they are subject to change.  
3. Assign scores to set criteria 
After defining the criteria, you want to assign scores to each of those factors. These scores help decide which factors amongst all are the most important and which ones are least important. 
Some systems also believe in grading these criteria. The grading system denotes “A” as a highly relevant lead and the following letters as less critical. These grades are again set in alphabetical order. 
Whilst some models only utilize scores to qualify leads. There are also other models where there is a combination of scores and grading systems. They are usually set in alphabetical order, i.e., A, B, C, D, and so on. 
4. Automate the lead scoring process 
This is the final capstone in the scoring process. As you must already know, lead scoring isn’t a piece of cake.  
It requires a lot of time and resources in order to develop a process that qualifies good quality leads consistently. And it also requires quite a much of manual effort.  
So, why not automate the process using a CRM? Utilizing a CRM can not only help you automate the process but also provide a platform to manage those captured leads. 
But which is the best CRM, you ask? Look no further! Salesmate CRM can help you automate the entire scoring process.

Best practices for SaaS lead scoring 
SaaS lead scoring looks easy, but it could become tricky sometimes. Therefore, here are a few best practices to keep in mind, so you can avoid making these mistakes: 
1. Consult sales and customer success teams to set rules 
Each team thinks from a specific perspective. So, the customer success team might think from a different perspective than the sales team. 
That being the case, it’s important to define the qualification criteria in collaboration. Blending different thought processes from marketing, sales, and customer success can help develop solid criteria. 
2. Choose a highly customizable tool 
As we discussed earlier, the last step is to automate the scoring process using a tool. When choosing the lead scoring tool, ensure that it has highly customizable features. 
Salesmate is one of that software that can be customized as per your use. It’s flexible to fit! Check out how you can add your own flavor and nuances to Salesmate. 
3. Set up different scoring models for different plans or products 
Lead scoring is also a process that’s different for each plan/product. Because each plan/product has a different structure, usage, and target audience. So, the qualification factors also differ. 
4. Take feedback from salespeople on lead quality 
As a marketing professional, you might think that ‘Oh! This lead satisfied all the qualification factors. It must be a good lead’. But is it really? Sales teams can help you verify that.  
Taking feedback from the sales teams can help ensure that quality leads are passed on consistently, resulting in an effective scoring process.

Moving on! The next thing on the agenda is the SMART model. It will help you to set action-driven call objectives. 
Utilizing the SMART model for setting sales objectives
Most sales leaders rely on the SMART formula to create winning call objectives. 
It helps to make SMART sales call objectives that are achievable. And it’s very fondly used to set winning sales goals.  
Top-tier sales leaders leverage SMART sales call objectives to increase their call engagement time with prospects. 
Let’s learn how to create high-quality objectives with the SMART formula. 

1. Specific
For a sales call, the initial step is to be more precise in deciding the call objective by narrowing down your demands. 
For instance, if you’re in a stage of the sales process where the prospects are convinced of your product efficiency, the only concern for them is the pricing. 
So here, your objective must be to offer insights that convince them to settle with the pricing or provide options that suit them.  
To win your sales goals, you need to be specific about what you want to accomplish from sales calls. The more specific you are with your sales goals, the better result you will draw.  
2. Measurable 
To measure if your rep succeeds in meeting their sales call objective, you must decide on some key elements. It’s quite similar to defining sales KPIs but instead used to measure success in meeting the sales goals.  
So, what is the right way to measure the success of a sales call objective? Fixate on accomplishing at least one “ultimate goal” from the call. And that goal can be the measure of your success. 
For instance, you made a cold call with multiple objectives like checking the quality of the lead, whether the lead is a qualified lead or not, and pitched your product to get a meeting booked.  
Now, you’ve called the person, and they’ve shown interest but asked to call on the weekends. So, here your one objective is met as you’ve discovered that it is a quality lead for your product/services. 
Out of multiple sales call objectives, if you met a few or at least one, count that as a measure of success. 
3. Action-oriented 
One primary objective of calls is to qualify more leads and move them through the buyer’s journey. This way, your sales reps will uncover their needs, stress points, and desires associated with your brand.  
Does the call objective focus on advancing the customer in the buying process or expanding your knowledge of the customer?   
When setting your call objective, ensure that it somehow; moves your prospects in the buying process. Plus, also expand your rep’s knowledge about the prospect’s intent.  
Action-oriented calls are the one that helps to determine the customer’s intent associated with your product/services.  
For instance, the objective of a customer-service sales call should be to get an update about how the product is working for them, any difficulty faced, or any suggestions to improve. 
4. Realistic 
This element of the SMART formula states that your sales call objectives must be achievable.  
Have you heard the phrase, “over-promising & under-delivering”?  
Because if you set objectives that are too far-fetched, then it’ll lead to failure. An example of a far-fetched objective would be “Setting a target to make 100 calls in one day”. 
On average, there are about 7 people as decision-makers in a firm of 100-500 employees. So, if you aspire to sell a product/service on the first sales call itself, then that might be a too far-fetched objective.  
Because selling a product/service in just one meeting would be a tough task, even for an established brand. 
So, ensure that the objectives of your sales calls are achievable! 
5. Time-bound 
When you start a race, you need to ensure there’s a finish line! So, being time-bound to achieve the sales call objectives plays a key role in the success of those objectives.  
Because not only do you have to define realistic sales goals, but you also determine a certain time frame to achieve them. Setting highly-promising objectives that can’t be accomplished within a specific time frame will be quite challenging. 
So, setting the right goals is essential to win at achieving the defined sales objectives. 
Sales calls are a bag of opportunities only for those who set the right objectives.  
Our methodology of sales call objectives at Salesmate

Open-ended questions help reps to get more information from customers by offering options or encouraging them to think and answer.  
This practice helps us to qualify our leads, uncover prospects’ intent, promote brand trust, and earn credibility. Here are the three questions for setting your next sales call objectives. 
1. How good do you feel about this particular call?   
Knowing your prospect’s concern associated with your sales call pitch is important. It helps you identify leads’ quality.

Informative and useful  
Informative but not useful  

The prospects’ response will help you qualify the lead for further stages of your sales pipeline. 
2. What do you see as the next action steps?  
If your prospects have shown interest by answering the first question positively, this question will help you identify their needs and concerns.    
Sales reps that are intelligent to influence potential customers, moving them through the buyer’s journey and providing a solution get conversion easily.    
To navigate the deal, you can provide options like,  

Book a demo  
Schedule an in-person meeting  
Schedule a video call 

3. What other areas would you like to discuss moving forward? 
For every sales call, there must be a pertinent CTA near the end of the discussion. This question works more like a CTA and helps reps to get new agenda to discuss in a follow-up sales call.  
The answer will expand your sales reps’ knowledge of customers’ stress points. Now, on the next call, your sales reps can try to explain how their product/services are a solution to their problem.   
The answer to this question will also reveal the areas of interest of your prospects that might give you a chance to create the need to fulfill it with your brand. 
Measuring and evaluating sales call objectives

6 Best sales qualification frameworks you can choose from 
Every sales rep uses a certain lead qualifying framework to define the likelihood of a lead to turn a paying customer. 
Here are the 6 best lead qualification frameworks that you can choose from: 
1. BANT 

BANT is a long-established framework to qualify sales leads. It is developed in the year 1950 by IBM.   
It emphasizes a lot on a budget of the lead. Can the lead purchase your product or service?  
Budget is considered a sales qualification criterion, as the lead must have a budget that matches your solution.   
Then, it focuses on whether the lead has the authority to make purchasing decisions.
This is followed by understanding the prospect’s problem, making it easy for the sales rep to pitch the required solution and create a great impact.   
This framework enables the sales reps to qualify the leads in initial calls, instead of spending days or weeks. Lastly, it focuses on the urgency of the lead’s purchase.  
Let’s look at the pros and cons of this framework. 
Pros: 

It saves time in the qualification process. 
Using the BANT framework ensures a short sales cycle. 
It is flexible and reliable. 

Cons: 

It is a seller-focused approach, which sometimes irritates the customers. 
This isn’t the fastest framework to implement. 

 2. ANUM  

It’s the modern version of the BANT framework developed by Ken Krogue.   
ANUM framework takes a customer-centric approach. It focuses on the rep getting in touch with the concerned person. This saves a lot of time for both parties.  
With ANUM, sales reps ensure that the lead is the decision-maker before taking the discussion ahead.    
It then guides to focus on the lead’s problem and offer a solution.   
Further, the framework focuses on understanding the urgency of implementing the solution from the prospect’s end.   
And lastly, considers the evaluation of their budget range to understand their eligibility for your offered service.   
Let’s look at the pros and cons of the ANUM framework. 
Pros: 

It saves time for the reps by making them contact the decision-maker.  
It clarifies the potential lead that can be moved down the process.

It qualifies leads on the decision-making power, which means if someone is a gatekeeper, they would be disqualified. However, they can lead to the right person.  

3. MEDDIC 

MEDDIC framework was developed during the 1990s by Jack Napoli and Dick Dunkel. This framework majorly focuses on knowing more about your prospect. 
This framework considers various aspects of the lead while you qualify it. It starts with understanding the measurable value your solution provides to the prospects.  
Then, move forward to identify whether you are communicating with the economic buyer; the one who’s responsible for making the buying decision. And understand the factors that will affect their decision-making process. 
Then identify pain points to make your pitch more effective. Lastly, this framework talks about “sales champion.”   
This is a person from the client’s organization that will help you sell better or would sell on your behalf. They will keep you updated with the decision-making steps and help you with pointers that will close the deal for you.

In a scene of the movie “The Wolf of Wall Street,” Jordan Belfort, a successful stockbroker, addresses his sales team upon dealing with their failure and motivates them to sell more stocks.   
One of the brokers in the team complains about the poor quality of leads.   
Then, Belfort replies by promising to give the best leads to the top-performing sales reps of the week. This has created competition among the sales team, as all sales brokers will now hustle to be the best performer to get high-quality leads.   
This movie scene typically indicates that having quality leads is important to get the conversion.  
According to the 2021 Marketing Attribution and Reporting Analysis, 25.9% of marketers mentioned that one of the biggest challenges they faced was understanding lead quality.  
25.9% is a considerable percentage for any business. However, if leads were scored, they could easily qualify the leads that are valuable and have a high conversion rate. 
This blog covers top lead scoring models in the market and how a lead scoring model can help you identify and prioritize the best prospects for a business. 
But before we explore the models, let’s look at the nitty-gritty of it.
What is a lead scoring model & how can it help you qualify better leads? 
The lead scoring model basically means a framework to qualify leads based on specified criteria.  
The criteria are dynamic and are decided based on factors such as; 

How much interest are prospects shown towards our product/services? 
Which industry your prospect belongs to? (For B2B businesses) 
Where does your prospect live? 
Do they have the relevant affordability budget? 
What are the varied time frame audiences you have? 

And many more precise factors that are unique to your business. 
Fundamentally, lead scoring models are based on certain criteria. Here are a few examples.

Now, every time a criterion is fulfilled, a few points are assigned to the lead. Let’s understand with an example, suppose you are selling an email marketing tool as your product. 
And lead with a 70+ score is an SQLs for you. 
Now, if any prospect performs the following action on your website, you score them for each step taken. 
Say; 
Visited your pricing page- 15 points 
Downloaded a product knowledge eBook- 10 points 
Signed for a product webinar: 20 points 
Signed up for a free trial- 20 points 
Opened your sales and marketing email- 10 points 
So, a total of 75 scores is given to that lead and automatically qualifies as SQLs.  
This means once a lead reaches the point threshold you set, it is considered qualified.   
Also, lead scoring is not bound to just marketing. Sales teams also leverage them to evaluate sales-qualified leads. 
5 most popular lead scoring models in the market 
Let’s take a look at various models to score leads, and then you can decide on which model is the ideal fit for your organization:  
USP (Unique Selling Point) Pricing Model / Solution If you want to let an algorithm primarily handle your lead scoring process using artificial intelligence and qualify leads with minimum effort, then Lead Pilot is for you. It allows minimal input from the user in the lead scoring process. $249 / Monthly Lead Pilot Model If you have a substantial budget to invest in a tool, use multiple efficiency protocols, ensure high-quality lead qualification, qualify based on recent activities performed by the lead, and have a lifespan for the lead, then this model is for you. $1999 / Monthly Madkudu Likelihood to Buy Model With this model, if you wish to qualify leads using positive scoring as well as negative scoring when an undesired action is performed, then Marketo is for you. Contact Sales Adobe Marketo Model If you wish to qualify leads primarily on the basis of implicit and explicit data using a simple scoring matrix, then Eloqua is for you. Contact Sales Oracle Eloqua Model If you wish to qualify leads based on the PAIN score & FIT score, then this model is for you: Not Available Juan Merodio Model Salesmate is the best option for your business if you’re looking for a smart solution where you can create your own lead scoring model, specify your own custom criteria, choose custom qualification thresholds, apply positive or negative scoring, and want total control over your lead scoring model. $12 / Monthly Salesmate 
Note: Pricing mentioned in the above table is subject to change. 
1. Oracle Eloqua lead scoring model
The Eloqua lead scoring model by Oracle evaluates primarily two factors: 

Profile criteria: This criterion focuses on the demographic data of the lead, i.e., the job title, company information, value of the deal, and more. This is also known as explicit data of a lead. After evaluation, the lead is given a profile score of A, B, C, or D. 
Engagement criteria: This criterion focuses on the lead’s behavioral information, such as how long they spent on the website and how responsive they were to ads on social media. This is also known as the implicit data of a lead. After evaluation, the lead is given an engagement score of 1, 2, 3, or 4. 

Post the score evaluation of profile and engagement, both of the scores are combined, and a score is assigned to the lead. With A1 being the most qualified & D4 being the least qualified. 

2. Adobe Marketo lead scoring model
The Marketo lead scoring model also operates similarly to the Eloqua model. However, it also uses implicit and explicit information in lead scoring.   
But, with Marketo, it assigns certain set points for each action taken by the lead.  
In this model, Marketo assigns a score between 0 – 30 points for demographic attributes: 

1 point for page visited or email opened 
15 points for searching “Marketo Engage” on Google 

As positive points are assigned to leads, there is also a concept called ‘negative scoring’.   
Just like you add points to a lead score in positive scoring, in negative scoring, you remove set points from the score for performing undesirable actions.  
So, in Marketo, – 50 points are assigned if one were to unsubscribe from email lists, – 10 points for an entry-level job title, and so on.  
Ergo, here is how Marketo moves forward with a lead in the Sales Pipeline.  
Leads with less than 65 points are classified as “prospects” for nurturing, while those with more than 65 points are classified as “sales-worthy leads” and further handed over to the sales team for conversion. 
3. Lead Pilot
Lead Pilot, an inbound marketing tool, has built one of its own lead scoring model. It operates under the core premise that the greater a lead’s score, the more qualified it is. The scoring range is from 1 to 100. 
Its algorithm considers multiple factors such as page visits, time spent on each page, actions taken, the lead’s engagement with content, and many more. 
Moreover, it also allows the admin to assign stars to a lead and considers their input. These aspects are considered, and a score is assigned to the lead. 

4. Juan Merodio lead scoring model 
The lead scoring model by Merodio uses a scoring matrix that evaluates scores on two factors: 

PAIN Score: This score states the potency of a problem faced by the lead. And based on this, a score between 0 – 10 is assigned. 0 indicating the lead has no problem & 10 indicating the lead is facing an intense problem and requires a solution soon. 
FIT Score: This score signifies how close the lead is to your company’s ICP (ideal customer profile).  


Post evaluating each score; a sum is generated. Wherefrom Merodio categorizes these leads into two ways; 

Cold leads
Warm leads
Hot leads

Or another is whether or not the lead is ready for more marketing or sales activity 

Marketing qualified leads(MQLs) 
Sale qualified leads(SQLs) 

5. Madkudu Likelihood to Buy model (LTB) 
Along with behavioral and intent data that are used in other lead models, Madkudu LTB model adds multiple efficiency protocols and lines to ensure high-quality lead qualification. 
The LTB score is derived from the combination of all the actions of a prospect in the last 90 days, factoring in the decay.  
Every event that the person takes is directly associated with two things. Firstly, the importance (weight) & secondly, a lifespan (decay).  
This model functions in 3 parts: 
Part 1: Weight calculation: Any action taken by the prospect is calculated on the below-mentioned bases: 

Importance = Points assigned to the event on the day the event was taken. 
Lifespan (Decay) = Number of days the action has been taken & will contribute to the overall LTB score. 

Part 2: Define segment thresholds: Now, we need to establish the minimum raw or threshold score that is required for a user to be considered as having a likelihood to buy.(“very high,” “high,” “medium,” or “low”) These segment thresholds are specific to your defined model. These scores can be adjusted to enhance the overall performance of the model. 
Part 3: Score Normalization: During this process, the LTB segment score that has been achieved is measured with a normalized score between 0 – 100. This prevents the over-addition of scores and gets you a final lead score. The normalization of the score is automatically done by Data Studio, ensuring your score lies within the scale from 0-100. 
Why do you need to build a unique lead scoring model? 
Lead score models are often designed to qualify specific types of leads based on certain set criteria.  
And what works for someone might not be an ideal fit for another.  
Therefore, it would be wise to create your unique model to score leads that consider the parameters you intend to use to qualify leads.   
Having your own lead scoring model would bring a plethora of quality leads for your sales reps to convert.
But thinking, where would you find a smart solution for that?

Therefore, the collaboration of your sales and marketing teams brings you an effective lead scoring process.
2. Assign points on both profile & engagement
Utilizing both categories; lead profile and engagement activities to assign point values leads is a part of good lead scoring strategy. This way, it becomes easier to assess a lead who is the best fit for the company.

{"prompt": "Return on sales 101: Understanding the ratio, importance, formula, and real-life example", "completion": "Key TakeawaysReturn on sales (ROS) is a metric that calculates the profit concerning operational costs. It explains the logic between revenue and operations.Return on sales is calculated by dividing operating profit by net revenue.ROS benefits your business by helping you improve operative potential, cutting material and labor costs, and aims at improving revenue by increasing sales figures.
All the revenue generated isn’t business profit.
To evaluate your company’s actual health and profitability status in a given time, you need to measure the revenue in relation to operating costs.
There are various ways to assess where your business is moving, profitable or not.
One of the most effective ways of calculating this is using the Return on sales (ROS) metric.
This blog covers the definition of return on sales, the formula, and influencing factors. So, let’s begin.
What is a return on sales ratio? 
The return on sales ratio measures how your company effectively generates profits from its sales. It measures the company’s performance by calculating the actual profit made.
ROS is calculated when you divide your operating profit by net sales generated. 
It is one of the most influential metrics that explain the logic behind the budget and sales strategies. 
Thinking about what increasing or decreasing ROS depicts? See the table below. 
Investors and creditors are the ones most interested in learning about a company’s return on sales ratio. They use this ratio to measure the performances between two companies for a given period. 
Let’s learn more about the importance of the return on sales. 
Why is the return on sales important? 
The return on sales ratio is important for every business, along with creditors and investors.
It helps creditors and investors make various decisions like reinvesting in the company, the company’s ability to pay back debts or pay potential dividends, etc.
It helps businesses measure yearly performance as the expenses and revenue keep varying yearly. So, the year making the highest revenue can only be considered profitable if the operating costs are included.
You can identify your company’s growth by comparing it to your competitors. However, it would be effective only when comparing companies of similar business lines and the same size.
For example, “Company A” makes $100,000 in revenue and spends $70,000 on operations for a given year. Conversely, “Company B” makes the same revenue but spends $50,000 on operations for the same year.
Company B, excelling in cost-cutting, will have a better return on sales ratio. Hence it will make higher profits and attract potential investors.
What is the return on sales formula, and how to calculate it?
ROS is calculated by dividing the operating profit or operating margin by your net sales revenue from your sales. Check out the return on sales formula below. 
Return on Sales= (Operating Profit/Net Sales) x 100 
The percentage in the return on sales formula above signals the profit made for every dollar you earn. 
You can calculate the return on sales of your company with these four simple steps. 

Let’s understand with an example to calculate return on sales. 
Suppose ABC is a software development company. And the company spent $1,200,000 as an expense this year, and its net sales for the year are $5,000,000. 
Now, once you subtract all your expenses, you’re the Revenue made, and you will get your profit. See below. 
Operating Profit= Revenue – Expenses 
= $5,000,000 – $3,800,000 
= $1,200,000 
So, now you have $1,200,00 as your operating margin. So, now we will use the value in return on sales formula. See below.
Return on Sales (ROS) = (Operating profit ÷ Net sales) x 100 
= ($1,200,000 ÷ $5,000,000) x 100 
 = 24% 
Additionally, it’s also important to remember that even if the ROS is 24% in this case, it doesn’t mean that the company is profitable. 
One thing to know about this metric is that it does not consider non-operating expenses such as interest, income tax, and other financial expenses. 
Not including these figures enables the creditors and investors to understand the expenses associated with the business’s core operations. 
Return on sales tells about the company’s operational efficiency. So that’s why it is also known as the operating profit margin. 
Comparison of ROS to other financial ratios  
To know your company’s overall financial performance, you must compare your return on sales with other key financial ratios, such as return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE).   
Here’s to notice. 

ROS measures profitability concerning your sales.  
ROA measures profitability concerning your assets. 
ROE measures profitability concerning your equity. 

ROS is a good metric to evaluate profitability concerning sales revenue.
But, remember, it does not consider non-operating expenses like financing structure and taxes. Therefore, looking at other financial ratios and metrics essential to assess the company’s overall financial health is best.

6 Factors influencing your return on sales  
Learn how you can utilize the return on sales formula to assess a company’s profitability. Six key factors can impact the ROS of your company.
1. Industry benchmarks 
Industry benchmarks are an indicator for companies to generate a level of profit. For example, if the industry return on sale is 10%, you are generating 12% ROS, which is considered reasonably good.
2. Your operating expenses 
A high cost of operating expenses will lead to a decrease in the ROS value. Thus, you will generate no or less profit. 
3. Gross profit margin 
The higher the gross profit margin of a company, more will be the ROS value. Thus, the company will be able to generate more profit from its sales revenue.
4. Sales growth 
Your company’s sales growth directly affects its return on sales ratio. Therefore, tremendous sales growth will increase the chance of generating more profit.  
5. Company trends 
When your ROS shows improvement with every passing year, your company becomes profitable. E.g., If your company shows 30% ROS for 2019-20, followed by a 35% ROS for 2020-21. It reveals that your business is progressing in an upward direction.
6. Competitors 
You work in the same environment as your competitor, so you incur similar material and labor costs. Strategies to beat your competitors to get a higher ROS.
Let’s learn how the return on sales ratio can help improve our business.
How do you improve ROS to boost your business? 
A high ROS means your company is generating good profit from your sales. Here’s how you can improve your business with the help of ROS.
1. Decreasing your operational expenses 
ROS counts operational costs. It encourages cutting operating expenses. This enables the organization to cut down on unnecessary operational expenses. This can be done by building good contact with your suppliers and negotiating the prices.  
You can employ technology solutions like Customer Relationship Management (CRM) to run the operations efficiently. Using a CRM tool is cost-effective yet systematic. 
2. Increasing your sales
If your company generate more net revenue, it can get a high ROS value which means more profit.  Sales Activity Tracking will help you find how your reps perform and the areas to improve. 
You can identify roadblocks based on your Sales Reports and leverage the insight for Sales Forecasting. 
3. Improving your gross profit margin 
Gross profit margin directly impacts your return on sales. So, by increasing its value, you can get a high ROS value. Thinking how to improve your it? Here are some tips.

4. Saves labor costs to an extent 
This includes spending more upfront and decreasing the labor cost later. For example, having Workflow Automation or investing more in sales training will produce skilled labor. 
5. Boost your operative efficiency

Frequently asked questions on ROS 
What is a good return on sales ratio?
When you divide the net income by net sales, you will get the return on sales. A ROS between 5% and 10% is good for most companies. This may seem like little; however, if your business heads into financial trouble, this number would be negative. 

How do they differ: Return on sales vs return on investment 
ROS measures the efficiency of a company concerning its net sales revenue, whereas ROI measures how efficiently a business performs concerning its investments.

How do they differ: Return on sales vs return on equity 
Return on sales and return on equity differ based on their reference point to measure gauge performance. In simple words, ROI considers sales revenue, whereas ROE considers equity.

How do they differ: Return on sales vs operating profit margin  
When calculating ROS, you take earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), whereas the operating profit margin formula considers the operating income. Once the operating expenses and cost of goods are deducted from net income, your remaining amount is your net operating income."}

According to a study, 59% of customers stated that they expect a business to be available via voice communication or phone calls in sales.  
So, sales calls are a vital mode of conducting and winning sales.  
Fundamentally, sales calls are telephonic conversations between a prospect and sales reps regarding a purchase of a product/service. And the ultimate objective of any sales call is to make the prospect into a paying customer or at least move them further across the sales pipeline. 
And the core purpose of the sales call is to better connect with the prospects and keep them informed about your brand’s products or services. And, most importantly, how they can benefit from using them. 
Effective sales calls also enable you to upsell or cross-sell your existing customers. 
Various types of sales calls are made during the entire sales cycle to accomplish different objectives. So, let’s go through the 7 types of sales calls reps conduct during a sales process. 
7 Types of sales calls  
During the sales process, there are various occasions where conducting a sales call might come in handy, such as during prospecting, discovery, objection handling, and more. Each type of sales call has a different purpose. 
Let’s look at different types of sales calls:
1. Cold calls  
Cold calling is basically contacting potential customers without any prior contact or relationship. It’s usually done in an effort to transform the prospect into a possible lead for the business. 
For instance, the calls made by credit card companies to sell a card to random people.
Also, keep in mind that 92% of prospects consider unidentified calls as spam. And 80% of sales calls go to voicemail. So, there is always the possibility that the person that’s being contacted may or may not be the potential customer for the business.
Purpose of Cold Calls
Cold calling is usually done to identify a prospect’s interests and whether they align with your brand’s offerings or not. Based on this, you can attract and engage with them. So, qualifying the prospect becomes much easier. 
Tips to make successful sales calls  
Cold calling is dead! That’s what is usually said. But that can’t be more untrue. At least in the B2B industry, because nearly 57% or more C-level leaders prefer to get a call from a sales rep. 
So, here are some result-driven tips for conducting effective cold calls: 
Conduct a detailed pre-call research 
Before making a cold call, do comprehensive pre-call research to know your ideal customer profile and buyer persona. 
If you know your customer persona, it will help you grab their attention and engage them. It also helps you to pitch customized offers making them feel important during the cold call. 
Prepare and practice your cold-calling script 
A cold calling script is the best support, as it includes key points that a rep must discuss in a flow when conducting a cold call.  
The sales call script is more of a helpful checklist. It contains descriptive answers to all the FAQs and insights on how to face sales objections. You must learn to cope with rejection and objections during a cold call.  
Here’s how to win at cold calls! Check out; the best cold calling scripts for all situations. 
Watch out for the right time for a cold call  
If you’ve made some calls and got a poor response or no response at all, then the timing could be a reason for that. 
To overcome this, analyze your call recordings and discover the hours in a day when your potential customers picked up and engaged more with you. Accordingly, schedule the calls for such specified times to enhance sales opportunities.   
Support of a sales CRM might help boost your sales productivity with features like call recording & forwarding, automatic voicemail drops, call tracking, etc.

2. Warm calls  
When a sales professional connects with a prospect, who has already shown some interest in the brand’s products or services via multiple mediums such as the website or cold calling, or something else, it can be identified as a warm call.
And, when considering warm calls, referrals work quite well. 92% of buyers trust referrals from their known people. So, with an existing personal connection, you have a 4.2 times more chance to get an appointment.
Here the prospects have an existing relationship with the business. For instance, it could be a follow-up to a cold call, a past buyer or opportunity, someone in your network, etc.   
For example, if a person signed up for the contact us web form on your landing page, you will make a warm call to enquire more about evaluating selling opportunities. 
Another example is if a person met you in a seminar, showed interest in your brand, and asked you to give a call in the upcoming weekend. Now, you would make a warm call to confirm of their interest in your brand. 
Purpose of Warm Calls
The purpose of warm calls is to entice the prospective customer with your product/services, influencing them to make a purchase. And if not the conversion, convincing them for a demo or in-person sales meeting can be one of the agenda of warm calls. 
Tips to make the best warm calls 
To help you win, here are the most effective tips when conducting warm calls. 
Prepare a checklist with key topics to discuss 
As warm calls are made to people who might have interacted with your business before, prepare to win. If you have any information about your prospect’s recent activity, leverage it to make the conversation personalized and relevant.  
Talk about things that are useful for your potential customers, highlighting the benefits for them.  
Make an impact with your opening lines 
Grab your prospects’ attention in a warm call with a catchy and meaningful opening line.   
A personalized opening line with an informative context about how you can help them to overcome their roadblocks can work for you.

3. Prospecting sales calls 
These are the initial sales calls to find possibilities to pitch in your product or service.  
There is a thin line that differentiates cold and prospecting calls, which you can understand better with a quote by Michael Phelan. 
“Prospecting means seeking out the right customer to pitch to; it requires research and intelligence. Cold calls are a blunt sales tactic to call potential buyers randomly, hoping that many of them might be in a buy mode.” 
Although, the motive of cold calls and prospecting is to discover the customer’s intent toward buying. 
Purpose of prospecting calls  
To build interest among the listening prospect about your product/services, convince them that you can solve their problems. 
Tips to make the best out of prospecting calls 
While conducting prospecting calls, try to focus on understanding the prospects’ needs and pain points to connect with them on a more personal level. But here are a few detailed tips to make the best out of prospecting calls:
Connect to prospects on LinkedIn 
With over 810 million LinkedIn users, your B2B prospects will defiantly be present there. 
You’ll able to find and connect with the decision makers before your prospecting call on LinkedIn. 
Here is the smart way to find your prospect’s profile on LinkedIn: Find information like: 

Based on location 
Based on previous education/college name 
Based on the companies they served 
Based on their skill endorsement 
Look at your competitor’s network 

Ask targeted questions and listen to the response 
Don’t just assume; discover the prospect’s needs and stress points. The best to draw in a sales call is by asking target questions. 
As per a resource, asking 11-14 questions brings an average win rate of 74%.
Here are a few targeted questions you should find answers to better understand customer’s intent: 
What are their top priorities at the moment?  
What are the challenges they are facing currently?  
What is the biggest roadblock in their growth?  
What solutions are they now relying on to overcome the roadblocks?  
Are they satisfied with those solutions?  
What would make them consider switching providers?  
What features are they expecting in the new solutions?  
What results would they wish to see if they start using product X in the coming quarter? 
4. Sales appointment calls  
A sales appointment call is made to finally have an open discussion on the prospect’s stress points and how the brand can help solve them.  
26% of clients said that poorly organized meetings impact customer relationships adversely. So, keep this in mind the next time you schedule a meeting and utilize efficient software that can help you schedule meetings and manage those leads.
Before this appointment setting, calls were made aiming to schedule a call/video meeting to discuss the product’s features and benefits in detail. 
During sales appointment calls, both the decision maker and sales rep agree to have a purposeful discussion.  
For example, a prospect is looking for a CRM for their financial advisor business. He was in conversation with a software company for a month.  And then, he has taken a 15-day free trial of the CRM software. After the free trial, the prospect received a sales appointment call for further discussions on buying or any queries. 
Purpose of sales appointment calls  
A sales appointment call is made once your reps have established a relationship with their prospects. The purpose is to indicate the features and benefits of your product/services to them. This way, you will move one step ahead in closing the deal.

Watch out for your tone and context 
Although the prospects have shown interest and are open for a sales appointment call, you cannot pressure them.  
Always be courteous, and better to ask, “Is it the right time to talk?” even if for a scheduled call. 
Be consultative during this call instead of being pitchy for sales. Try to include elements, such as customer stories, facts, and more, to convince them. This way, you can get a chance to convince them to purchase from you. 
Use social proof 
About 88% of buyers trust online reviews equally to personal recommendations. So, it is best to leverage all the social proofs you have to build trust and persuade your prospects to buy. 
Share case studies revealing the challenges faced by your customers and how you helped to overcome them. This is a great way to take your prospects into confidence. Plus, convince them that your offer is the right fit for them.  
You can talk about your happy customers during the call and send them the link via text or email just after the meeting. 
Use technology for a faster process  
For setting up tons of sales appointment calls each day, the sales automation CRM is the right tool to go with.   
You can set up an automatic pre-recorded voicemail drop if the prospect doesn’t respond. Plus, you can set reminders to schedule sales appointments. Saving you from losing opportunities.  
Use a meeting scheduler to book a new sales appointment or to reschedule if the prospect missed the scheduled one.  
Technology like a sales automation CRM helps you to conduct error-free tasks and support you in meeting your sales quotas. 
5. Follow-up calls  
Follow-up calls are made to the potential prospects to know about their decision regarding the purchase. In addition, these are calls made to know if the prospect with whom you are in the conversation has any purchasing plans soon.   
Also, nearly 44% of sales reps give up after the first follow-up call. So, don’t be this sales rep! Because 80% of sales demand a minimum of 5 follow-up calls after the meeting. 
Purpose of follow-up calls 
The purpose of follow up calls is to identify the lead’s position in the sales process. Remember, a follow up call is meant for more than just the decision stage. Sometimes follow-up calls are required in the consideration stage too. 
Tips to make the best out of follow ups calls  
Quick and on-point follow-up calls help to close more deals. Here are some tips to win doing follow-up calls. 
Plan your follow-up calls  
Conducting follow-up calls blindly or randomly would harm your brand value and can irritate your prospect. So, during your sales call, create a reason to follow up.  
For example, after giving a demo, you might indicate that we would love to take your valuable feedback to improve.  
Avoid these follow-up opening blunders 
Follow-ups need to have a good start; otherwise, all your efforts till now will go in vain. Most sales reps stumble and begin their follow up calls like: 

“I was calling to follow up on our proposal.”   
“I just wanted to ensure that you’ve received the email.”  

Never do this! As these are poor opening statements. Instead, speak something that holds your prospects to listen.    
Conduct follow up calls on time  
Conduct your follow-up on time, don’t be a minute late. 
Because your competitors are also after your prospects. So, make sure you don’t give them a chance to win. An on-time follow up call can bring the deal to your company.

7. Product launched sales calls

Ask for feedback 
One element that will always make your existing customer willingly respond is their feedback. Make them feel valuable and ask for feedback regarding the benefits and shortcomings.

Here’s where a sales qualification framework plays an irreplaceable role.

BANT framework has been a part of sales qualification for 70 years. 
Whether you’re just starting or a seasoned sales professional, this article will open a new perspective on BANT with tips on using it in a way that matches your modern sales. 
So, let’s dive deep in. 
What is the BANT framework?  
BANT is a sales qualification framework used to identify and pursue the most qualified prospects.  
The framework was formed in the year 1950 by IBM. Here, opportunities are identified by speaking to prospects or clients to determine their business and solution needs.  
The IBM guidance, BANT, is used as a standard approach for opportunity identifications within sales strategies.  
Using BANT helps reps to qualify sales leads during the discovery calls. BANT is the acronym that stands for: 
B- Budget 
A- Authority 
N- Need 
T- Timeline 
Let’s understand the entire process of the BANT framework in the following section. 
An insight into the BANT sales qualification process  
BANT qualification works in sync with its acronym. The process starts with the following:

Budget  
Isn’t it a perfect start to your day if your prospect’s budget matches your solution’s cost?
And so this is where the framework prioritizes lead means it considers the budget in the first place. 
Your prospect’s budget is often based on the value they think is appropriate or often on their interaction with your competitors.  
Many a time, they won’t have a budget at all. 
Hence, you must know your prospect’s budget bracket.  
Their budget should align with the value of your solution. E.g., in high ticket deals like B2B sales, budget is one of the key factors to uncover at initial sales calls. 
Once this is sorted, you can move ahead with the lead, as you won’t have to face budget issues during the decision making stage. 
Authority 
If luck favors you, you might start working directly with a decision-maker from the beginning.
However, this isn’t always the case. 
A lot of times, you have to move up the ladder and connect with the correct person.  
This is because various processes and businesses have different levels of decision-makers.  
For instance, in some businesses, decision makers are the accountants; in another, it’s the departmental heads; in some, the stakeholders etc.
BANT framework helps you figure out the final decision-makers from champions or brand advocates. 
This way, your reps can discover the chain of command. In addition, it educates them on whom to speak, when, and how to speak. 
Clarity on who is the decision maker enables sales professionals to plan their sales approach and move successfully down the process. 
Need 
After knowing their budget and the decision-maker, you must know their requirement that can solve their problem.  
The information allows your sales team to determine if there is an alignment between your solution and the customer’s pain point. 
You must explore your prospect solution, as it helps your team understand if they need to pursue the prospect or not. 
This step of the BANT qualification helps you and your reps to know that there are hidden needs that the prospect is not even aware of.  
And you can leverage the learning to show your product or service as an ideal solution to them. 
You should train your sales reps to be patient and listen to the prospects’ problems. And move ahead with accurate solutions throughout the sales pipeline. 
This insight helps strategically place your solution in the prospect’s business process and allows your reps to move a step closer to your customer. 
Timeline 
After knowing all the crucial aspects of qualifying leads, it’s essential to understand where the problem’s solution stands on the priority list.  
There can be various aspects that can be discovered based on timeline information. 
For instance. if a prospect’s timeline is too short, it might be possible that your solution may not be able to accommodate them.
Or, if the prospect’s timeline is far out, it is usual that the prospect still needs to identify your solution as a priority.
This allows your reps to treat the prospects as per their urgency to get the solution (if your product/service is the right fit for them).  
The prospect having the solution as their top priority needs to be attainted on the go, whereas the prospect for whom the solution isn’t the priority can be delayed.  
Establishing a timeline allows your team to qualify the lead as a hot prospect successfully. 
Moreover, when your reps get the clarity of the timeline, they can be prepared for the post-closure process. 
This is how the BANT framework helps you in qualifying sales-ready leads.  
Moving on to the BANT sales qualifying questions. This is learning to understand what are the ideal question to qualify better. 
BANT sales lead qualification questions that you must know

BANT sales work best for the sales team when leveraged effectively. Here are some tips that will add a new perspective on using BANT optimally to achieve more profitable results.   
1. Don’t consider BANT like a checklist 
To get the most out of BANT, sales teams should use the BANT sales framework as a qualification guide rather than a checklist. Qualification based on BANT should look like an interrogation. Also, reps must know how to create a flow of conversation from one question to another. 
2. Sales team must do a holistic lead assessment 
Though BANT considers some of the critical factors that are useful to influence the prospect to convert.
But sales professionals must assess leads holistically by considering other factors mentioned in other qualification frameworks. 
3. Frame and ask the right questions to qualify prospects
A key to successful qualification is to ask the right questions at the right time.  
So, create a short, relevant and simple yet exciting question that your prospects get interested in answering naturally. 
4. Prepare for unforeseen possibilities to qualify sales leads
BANT is a promising sales qualification framework on which sales teams can rely.  
But sales conversations are unpredictable, so train your reps to tackle unexpected discussions.  
Try to be flexible and always be willing to modify your approach as the situation demands. 
5. Review and modify
Every conversation will teach you something that helps you modify for good, even if you’re stepping with the BANT sales framework. 
So, review your sales calls closely. Then, feel free to make changes and try new approaches to improve your sales performance. 
You’ve now understood that BANT is more than just a checklist. Let’s conclude our today’s learning. 
Wrap up: How BANT lead qualification framework is useful in 2023
This framework was developed back when the business was done completely differently.  
The processes were longer and more time-consuming. But there’s a reason for still using it in 2023.  
When the business has a shorter sales cycle and is time/cost-effective, using BANT is just the cherry on the cake. Like in the case of discovery calls which are still a vital part of sales outreach.  
And using BANT qualifying questions in these calls allows you to find various essential details about the prospect.  
However, you must frame your pitch carefully, as not using the correct words will make the conversation unpleasant.  
Imagine asking the prospect- What’s your budget?! you don’t want to do this.  
Lead qualification is the collaborative work of sales and marketing teams.
If the lead generation is effective and scoring is done strategically, then sales qualification can help you boost conversion effortlessly.
Hence, you must be open to new ways to boost your lead qualification strategy.

For instance, in some businesses, decision makers are the accountants; in another, it’s the departmental heads; in some, the stakeholders etc.
BANT framework helps you figure out the final decision-makers from champions or brand advocates. 
This way, your reps can discover the chain of command. In addition, it educates them on whom to speak, when, and how to speak. 
Clarity on who is the decision maker enables sales professionals to plan their sales approach and move successfully down the process. 
Need 
After knowing their budget and the decision-maker, you must know their requirement that can solve their problem.  
The information allows your sales team to determine if there is an alignment between your solution and the customer’s pain point. 
You must explore your prospect solution, as it helps your team understand if they need to pursue the prospect or not. 
This step of the BANT qualification helps you and your reps to know that there are hidden needs that the prospect is not even aware of.  
And you can leverage the learning to show your product or service as an ideal solution to them. 
You should train your sales reps to be patient and listen to the prospects’ problems. And move ahead with accurate solutions throughout the sales pipeline. 
This insight helps strategically place your solution in the prospect’s business process and allows your reps to move a step closer to your customer. 
Timeline 
After knowing all the crucial aspects of qualifying leads, it’s essential to understand where the problem’s solution stands on the priority list.  
There can be various aspects that can be discovered based on timeline information. 
For instance. if a prospect’s timeline is too short, it might be possible that your solution may not be able to accommodate them.
Or, if the prospect’s timeline is far out, it is usual that the prospect still needs to identify your solution as a priority.
This allows your reps to treat the prospects as per their urgency to get the solution (if your product/service is the right fit for them).  
The prospect having the solution as their top priority needs to be attainted on the go, whereas the prospect for whom the solution isn’t the priority can be delayed.  
Establishing a timeline allows your team to qualify the lead as a hot prospect successfully. 
Moreover, when your reps get the clarity of the timeline, they can be prepared for the post-closure process. 
This is how the BANT framework helps you in qualifying sales-ready leads.  
Moving on to the BANT sales qualifying questions. This is learning to understand what are the ideal question to qualify better.

Though BANT has been a constant standard that sales teams look upon for qualifying prospects in a sales process.
But apart from BANT, there are some modern other frameworks available to boost your sales conversions. Let’s learn what they are.
Alternatives to BANT for sales teams
With the changing notion of sales, SDRs and managers are adapting alternatives that offer more comprehensive learning of their potential customers. 
Here is the list of top sales qualification frameworks recognized by A+ sales leaders. 
Sales qualification framework When this framework is the best to use? BANT When a lead has a specific budget. It is used by organizations that have high-deal prizes. ANUM When the client has a long and complicated decision-making process. This framework should be adopted when dealing with large-sized companies.  MEDDIC Helpful with long sales cycles e.g., while launching new software or selling a new version of a solution. CHAMP When you want to focus on understanding your target audience in the long run. FAINT When the lead has huge funds and makes unplanned purchases. The industries with unplanned buyers are the ones that must implement this framework.  GPCTBA & CI When you have enough time to understand prospects needs and goals.  
Tips on using BANT framework to get better sales opportunities
BANT sales work best for the sales team when leveraged effectively. Here are some tips that will add a new perspective on using BANT optimally to achieve more profitable results.   
1. Don’t consider BANT like a checklist 
To get the most out of BANT, sales teams should use the BANT sales framework as a qualification guide rather than a checklist. Qualification based on BANT should look like an interrogation. Also, reps must know how to create a flow of conversation from one question to another. 
2. Sales team must do a holistic lead assessment 
Though BANT considers some of the critical factors that are useful to influence the prospect to convert.
But sales professionals must assess leads holistically by considering other factors mentioned in other qualification frameworks. 
3. Frame and ask the right questions to qualify prospects
A key to successful qualification is to ask the right questions at the right time.  
So, create a short, relevant and simple yet exciting question that your prospects get interested in answering naturally. 
4. Prepare for unforeseen possibilities to qualify sales leads
BANT is a promising sales qualification framework on which sales teams can rely.  
But sales conversations are unpredictable, so train your reps to tackle unexpected discussions.  
Try to be flexible and always be willing to modify your approach as the situation demands. 
5. Review and modify
Every conversation will teach you something that helps you modify for good, even if you’re stepping with the BANT sales framework. 
So, review your sales calls closely. Then, feel free to make changes and try new approaches to improve your sales performance. 
You’ve now understood that BANT is more than just a checklist. Let’s conclude our today’s learning. 
Wrap up: How BANT lead qualification framework is useful in 2023
This framework was developed back when the business was done completely differently.  
The processes were longer and more time-consuming. But there’s a reason for still using it in 2023.  
When the business has a shorter sales cycle and is time/cost-effective, using BANT is just the cherry on the cake. Like in the case of discovery calls which are still a vital part of sales outreach.  
And using BANT qualifying questions in these calls allows you to find various essential details about the prospect.  
However, you must frame your pitch carefully, as not using the correct words will make the conversation unpleasant.  
Imagine asking the prospect- What’s your budget?! you don’t want to do this.  
Lead qualification is the collaborative work of sales and marketing teams.
If the lead generation is effective and scoring is done strategically, then sales qualification can help you boost conversion effortlessly.
Hence, you must be open to new ways to boost your lead qualification strategy.

{"prompt": "15 Awesome solar lead generation ideas you must try in 2023", "completion": "Key TakeawaysThe solar industry is growing rapidly, with nearly 3,000 companies in the USA alone.Solar lead generation is crucial for companies' success in the solar industry.Top marketing ideas for solar lead generation include using property intelligence tools, leveraging older solar leads, getting positive online reviews, etc.
Solar power capacity has grown from 0.34 GW to 97.2 GW since 2008.
The increasing demand for solar power is evident. So in the coming years, we will see more businesses focusing on solar as their center. Study reveals that there are nearly 3,000 solar companies in the USA alone as of now.
With increasing competition in this space, lead generation would be a tough nut to crack.   
And that’s our goal for this article.
I’ll unleash all the high-performing tactics on solar lead generation.   
But first, let’s identify the topmost challenges that solar companies are facing as we speak.   
3 Key challenges for solar lead generation faced by solar companies 
 Here are the three top challenges that solar panel companies face.
1. Too many eligibility criteria to qualify as solar leads
Solar technology is booming, but the sales process is daunting due to the complex eligibility criteria.  
To be a potential solar lead, one has to mark checks on many boxes:  

You need to be a homeowner with a decent bank credit score for residential solar services.  
A home can’t have shade on the roof.  
The roof must also adhere to specific standards. For instance, it should be made with suitable materials, can’t have dormers, and more.  

You can set up a solid lead qualification process to ease the pain. But I think there are many restrictions in this industry compared to others.
2. Brand recognition 
Solar sales thrive on the brands that it creates. It is crucial for solar installers to present themselves as a reputable company.
To get this part right, a business must invest a significant amount of time and money in marketing and PR to build trust.   
3. Reaching out to potential customers & load balancing 
The primary tussle is that you have a big-ticket prospect, which means it is way more challenging to close solar leads compared to selling subscriptions to an OTT platform.   
You need an adopt an omnichannel approach to get your prospects into confidence, plus speed up the task.  
For example, if you wish to close a solar deal, it requires an in-person visit to assess that particular home’s condition.
This process of reaching out to potential customers creates the challenge of load balancing.   
There are times when your sales reps can be busy with other leads, or they might have to encounter no-shows.  
So, to boost your solar sales, your company’s customer management must be balanced against your multiple clients dealing (from online interaction, phone calls, or in-person meetings).

15 Solar marketing ideas to boost solar lead generation
To generate high-quality solar leads, you need effective tactics to approach clients, followed by a little hard work. Let’s learn how. 
1. Getting listed on solar directories 

Directories are considered neutral and trusted sources by search engines. They share your company’s information while also providing a direct link to your website.  
For every business, directories have become a default activity.
I wouldn’t expect tons and tons of leads from directories, but it’s necessary to be present in these directories.
However, if you have the budget, you can run ads on directories. You’ll receive more targeted leads, and you’ll beat the competition – sort of!
2. Have a user-friendly website  

Having a user-friendly and up-to-date website has become a basic necessity for any brand. 
For instance, you drive your audience to your website via directories and social media pages with paid ads, etc.
Now once a solar prospect lands on your site, what they expect is an intuitive design, pleasing aesthetics, and a clear value proposition.  
A visible and relevant call-to-action is necessary on each landing page where you get the most traffic to maximize the chances of lead generation.  
For solar lead generation, it’s absolutely necessary to add a form to your landing page.

3. Share high-quality videos and photos of your product 
As you aren’t just selling black panels but a lifestyle choice.
So, make it look as elegant as possible. You can offer real-life photos and videos of your products.   
One of the best ways to move forward is creating videos on how the process of installation would look like. Because people are curious about it.
Answer these questions in your videos:

How long will it take to install the solar panels?
Is your home suitable for solar panel installation?
How much does a typical project cost?
How much money will a customer save from solar every month?

Your prospects are going to make your product a part of their home. So, it’s natural that they wish to know what it would look like.   
4. Run paid ads to get solar leads faster

Buyers have evolved. They do homework first. The best way to capture a buyer is in the consideration stage.
That’s where paid ads work best.
Here’s how you can use paid ads to help you generate leads.  

Target users who search for products like yours. Facebook ads are a good option.  
Retarget users based on their prior interaction with your ads, website, or app.   
Show your ads to users who search for specific keywords such as ‘solar companies near me’ or ‘best deals to buy solar panels’.    
Show your ads on websites that are most visited by your targeted niche (Ex: directories). 

5. Conduct property intelligence research 
Property intelligence research is one of the best examples of how technology can be leveraged to generate high-quality leads.  
Google Project Sunroof lets you find suitable residents pertaining to specific zip codes.   
Google Sunroof helps to identify areas and homes that are most receptible for solar installation. It is helpful in countries that don’t have universally sunny climates.   
Another tool, such as Property Radar, allows you to narrow down financially prepared solar leads. Also, it helps to discover recently built neighborhoods that don’t have towering trees.
6. Modify your strategies to get residential and commercial solar leads
Create sections within your website for residential and commercial solar buyers. This way, you can leverage your single website to target different audiences. 
Residential and commercial solar leads have different requirements, so they need to create content that motivates each type individually.
For example, solar incentives, budget, and tax benefits are different for both kinds of solar panel buyers.
The best way forward is to create different assets for both types.

Separate landing pages
Separate learning materials
Separate lead magnets

7. Cost savings calculators

Here’s a list of the customary questions that a homeowner has when they want to switch to solar.  

What size of solar installation do I need?  
What will it cost me?  
How much savings can I make on my utility bills?  
How much power supply would it generate? 

Here’s how offering the solar calculator on your site is a profitable move.  

Your brand can earn a prospect’s trust by giving them practical answers to the above critical questions.  
Based on these answers, they can decide their solar installation’s size (in kW).  

 Users can be impressed with your services and may sign up for free consultation forms. 
8. Make content marketing a top priority 
Content is a long-term strategy that will generate solar leads for your brand.
As solar products are a bit tricky to understand, educating your prospects can be highly beneficial for your brand.  
You can generate online leads by creating relevant content. Try developing buyer personas based on their age, demographics, income, interests, and more.   
You can create content around a topic that works as motivation to switch to solar (like saving money, home improvements, or environmental benefits).  
Creating content is not enough. You also need to distribute content to relevant spaces.
So, social sharing, guest blogging, micro-blogging, and link building are the most effective techniques.
9. Recycle your older solar leads 
As mentioned, solar products are big ticket sales. Often, prospects enquired early but took a long time to decide because of the cost associated. 
Keep your lead data safe, along with all the past conversations. A CRM tool can help in managing your data safely to leverage it anytime, anywhere.
Have your sales team initiate a follow-up call, run an email campaign with discounts on solar panel installation, or send e-newsletters on relevant/helpful topics that are likely to be open.  
Based on the response, segment them as cold, warm, and hot.  
Nurturing such warm solar leads to keep the conversation alive with such warm leads would give you many conversions.

10. Use social media to extend your reach 
As of 2022, the US has 302 million social media users and a 90% penetration rate, making it the third largest.   
A solid social media presence will help boost interaction with potential clients while establishing you as an authority for solar information.  
Now you must determine on which social platform your ideal customers spend their time.
It can be predicted that residential clients are likely to be found on Instagram or Facebook, whereas commercial clients prefer LinkedIn.  
To garner maximum benefit from social media, you must have a solid social media strategy. For example, using lead gen ads, you can capture client information without consuming much of their time.

11. Referrals 
Referrals are the quickest and most efficient way to boost sales.
Irrespective of the lengthy marketing funnel, customers would most trust the word of a family member or friend.   
Plus, you also get to see how setting up personally will help make a firmer decision.  
Remember that you can leverage your existing solar customer to get new leads. Offer an exciting referral bonus to them. This is a cost-effective way to get more leads. 
12. Present a good brand image on business review sites
Do you know? 49% of buyers trust online reviews as much as they trust a recommendation from their friends and family.
Present a good company profile on some of the top business review sites that your customers look up.
If you don’t know, Solar Reviews, Yelp, EnergySage, and Google My Business are some of the trusted business review sites for solar companies.
Try to provide a great customer experience by offering valuable service. So that you can ask happy customers to leave positive online review/feedback. This way, you can create a good image for your company.
13. Target homeowner communities 
Local homeowner communities are some of the best places for your brand to get business.   
For this, you need to approach different communities and get in touch with their secretaries or board members.
Many communities today also have dedicated websites that present you with sponsorship opportunities.  
You can list your brand on their website and can also sponsor different festivals, picnics, tournaments, exhibitions, etc., to promote your brand.  
Smaller communities might not have a website but might have a Facebook group that gives you the required information.
Even if these groups don’t allow solicitors, you can use them for making initial contact with the leading authorities. 
14. Use target keywords smartly to stay at the top of SERPs 
Have you noticed how companies rank at the top of search engines without paying for the same?  
These companies work extensively on optimizing their content with keywords that users are already searching for.  
This tactic shows eventual results as and when the search engine starts recognizing a particular company as an authority for a specific topic or thread of content.  
But to become an authority, you must offer relevant information that your potential customers want to consume. 
You must discover the possible keywords that your prospects are using to search for you or your competitors online.  
For instance, below is an image of the searches that are possibly made by solar leads. 

Google itself provides you with multiple keywords phrase that prospects have used.  
You must leverage keyword research tools like Ahrefs and SEMrush that can help you get the most targeted keywords based on their search volume. 
15. Case studies 
Case studies paint a real-life picture to your potential leads of how your services exceeded a client’s expectations.   
However, companies don’t know how to leverage case studies for organic lead generation.  
Here are some ideas to create impactful case studies with the support of your paying customers:

Ask your existing customers to state the benefits of switching to solar.  
Ask the customer to emphasize why your company is the best fit to make that switch.  
Offer generous discounts to existing customers who agree to feature in your next case study.  

Smartly place these on your high-converting landing page, send them via email marketing campaign, and use them in paid ads.     
Potential customers might be more interested in hearing your sales pitch, with a happy customer vouching for your services. 
So, show the case studies of your happy customers to potential prospects during your in-person sales visits.
Bottomline
Here’s a quick recap on some of the key marketing ideas for solar lead generation. 

Use multiple channels/tools to diversify your solar marketing approach.  
If you’re a newbie, work on your basics, such as having a user-friendly website, content marketing, SEO, etc.

67% of potential customers don’t convert into sales. 
So, does this mean that sales reps aren’t putting in enough effort to convert leads?  
No! It’s primarily due to the ineffective lead qualification process done by sales reps, according to Spotio. 
That’s a lot of lost leads!
This also means that only 33% of the leads get converted, and they weren’t even qualified on whether or not they’re right for the business. And that’s a big problem! 
So how can you filter the leads that are most valuable for your business easily? 
By setting up an efficient lead qualification process that filters leads who have a higher chance of converting. 
What is lead qualification? 
Lead qualification is the process of determining if a lead is the best fit for your business or not.
It is one of the crucial tasks at the initial stage of the sales and marketing processes.  
It is a vital step as it helps allocate the efforts of sales and marketing teams efficiently.
This segmentation helps you to understand your buyer persona in detail, personalize communication, shorten the cycle, sell confidently, and build an efficient sales engine. 
Now, let’s get to the important part! 
4 Steps to successfully qualify leads
Let’s understand the process of lead qualifying in 4 simple steps: 

1. Develop an ideal customer profile (ICP) 
Initially, you want to conduct in-depth research on your customers and create an ideal customer profile.
This would help you learn about all the vital information you need to know about your customers.   
To start with, prepare a questionnaire consisting of the questions you would want the answers to from your customers. Here are a few examples for you to get started: 

Who would use this product/service? 
What would be their job title or position? 
Which industry do they belong to? 
What problem does my product/service solve? 
What are their demographics? (For e.g.: age, gender, education, employment, etc.)  
What is the psychographics of the customer? (For e.g.: values, interests, lifestyle, etc.) 

These were just a few of the many questions that can help you learn more about your customers.
And by answering these questions, you can avoid wasting effort and time on prospects that are unlikely to become customers.
Also, don’t forget to take a close look at the data you’ve collected about customers like a detective on a case.
See if any patterns and trends pop out. This will help you identify the common characteristics of your ideal customer.  

To analyze the data in a more precise manner and create an actionable plan. Your CRM would be pretty helpful in acquiring datasets.
Additionally, here are a few things to keep in mind while creating your ideal customer profile: 

Keep it simple, don’t make it too complex. 
Don’t limit yourself to one customer profile; create multiple variants. 
Ensure it’s actionable, so you can use it to make swift decisions. 
Finally, keep in mind that your ICP may change over time.

2. Define lead qualification criteria

The next step you want to focus on is defining the lead qualification criteria.
Fundamentally, it means that on what basis would you qualify leads for your business?  
These criteria are specific to each business and can vary based on factors such as the industry, product or service, and target market. 
Here are a few qualification criteria you can utilize for lead qualification: 

Is the prospect in the target demographic of the business? An answer to that could be, “I’ll only treat prospects from the United States.” 
Does the prospect have the budget or resources to make a purchase? An answer to that could be, “I’ll only treat prospects with a $50K ticket size or more.” 
Is the prospect a decision-maker within their organization? An answer to that could be, “I might start off the conversation with executives, but I’ll do the deal with C-level executives who are decision-makers.” 
What is the company size? An answer to that could be, “Only companies with 100+ employees are my target market.”
Have they interacted with the digital fronts of your business? (For e.g.: website, social media, etc.) 
Has the lead interacted with any of the ads being run by the business? An answer to that could be, “I’ll prefer prospects who come from ad sources as CAC is high for them.”

Answering these questions can help you qualify a prospect for a lead.
And, if you want to know more in detail about what other questions you would want to consider, check out our detailed blog on lead qualification questions here. 
Moreover, a pro tip to keep in consideration is that even though you’ve defined multiple qualification criteria, some criteria will always hold more importance than others. 
For example, a lead hasn’t attended a webinar and has only viewed the landing pages twice or thrice but is ready to convert and has a deal value of $300K.
Then, even though the lead didn’t meet all the defined criteria, it holds great importance. 
3. Create an automated lead scoring process 
You’re almost there! The next thing on the agenda after you’ve qualified the leads is scoring them. 
These rankings can be done on various grounds. For example, a lead that fills out a demo request form and attends the demo session might be ranked higher compared to a lead that didn’t even fill out the form. 

Also, just as you would assign positive scores for performing certain tasks such as subscribing to a newsletter. There are also negative consequences for performing undesired tasks, such as unsubscribing to the email newsletter.
To ease the lead scoring process, it’s best to automate the process with the help of an efficient CRM.  
A CRM can help ensure that the hot leads are handed off to the sales teams for converting, while the less promising leads get more nurturing before they’re ready for the big leagues. 
Take Salesmate, for example! Sales Automation in Salesmate CRM can help you can easily assign a lead score to your sales leads. And it has multiple triggers, conditions, and actions to choose from, allowing you to create a lead scoring process in minutes. 
Overall, lead scoring helps administer your efforts and time wisely.

4. Classify marketing and sales qualified leads 
Finally, when it comes to leads, you’ll end up with quite a lot of them – the hot ones, the almost-there, the not-even-close-to-its. So, how would you classify them? 
Leads that are showing curiosity, interacting with your websites more, are visiting multiple landing pages are keen to learn more about your business. So, with a little lead nurturing, they might convert. These could be classified as marketing qualified leads (MQLs). 
In contrast to that, leads that sign-up for webinars, book and attend demos, and download multiple lead magnets are more eager and are considering making a purchase. So, these kinds of leads would be classified as sales qualified leads (SQLs).  
Qualifying sales leads is a process that’s different for all businesses. So, either you can focus on creating your own lead qualification process and optimize it or utilize a framework best suited for your process. 
Below are a few of the many frameworks that you can utilize to get the qualification process started.
Choose an appropriate framework 
Each sale and customer are different, but every closed deal has something in common. A sales framework discusses specific traits of these closed deals, which can be used by reps for the future lead qualification process. 
Here are the top 3 lead qualification frameworks you should consider: 

1. BANT Framework:
It is an old-school framework that focuses on the primary pieces of information to qualify the lead. It originated from IBM, which focuses on opportunity-level requirements.
BANT stands for: 
B- Budget. Does the prospect have the budget to purchase the product/service? 
A- Authority. Is the prospect a decision-maker in the business? Does he/she have the authority to make a purchase? 
N- Need. Does the prospect have a need for the solution? 
T- Timeline. When is the prospect planning to purchase the product/service? 
This is how you can qualify a prospect using the BANT framework. 
This framework is simple to use and implement. To learn more about this framework, click here.  Do keep in mind that if you’re a fast-moving organization, this framework isn’t the most suitable for you. 
2. MEDDIC Framework:
This framework was pioneered by Jack Napoli while he was working with a technology company. MEDDIC was incredibly valued for its accuracy in forecasting. It was also valued by companies that sell to enterprise companies. 
MEDDIC stands for: 
M- Metrics 
E- Economic Buyer 
D- Decision Criteria 
D- Decision Process 
I- Identify Pain 
C- Champion 
You should consider using this framework when the cost of your sales process is quite high, it requires a change in behavior, and you have a clear understanding of the prospect’s purchasing process and their reasons for buying. 
This framework considers all the significant aspects of your prospect’s buying situation. To learn more about this framework, click here.  
3. CHAMP Sales Framework:
CHAMP stands for- 
C- Challenges  
A- Authority 
M- Money 
P- Prioritization 
It defines “Authority” as a “Call-to-action” and not a roadblock. This framework explains if you contact a low-level employee, you are assured that they won’t be the decision-maker.  
However, you shouldn’t end the conversation there. You should use their help to understand the organizational hierarchy to reach the decision-maker.  
Moreover, CHAMP focuses majorly on prioritization. With this framework, you can determine the prospect’s purchasing timeline. This framework lets you anticipate sales for a given period of time.

Conclusion 
Lead qualification is an essential step that’s fast-forwarded sometimes by most sales reps, but it is crucial. It plays a significant role in thorough resource allocation. This blog gave a detailed insight into the lead qualification process and frameworks.  
And you’re already aware that lead qualification is just one arrow in the quiver. With the qualification, you also have to take care of lead generation, capturing, management, and nurturing them to customers. This can’t be done without a solid ally by your side.

If you’re in sales, there is no doubt that you need to invest in CRM (Customer Relationship Management) software. 
As you need to have some way to keep track of prospects, customer interactions, and your sales pipeline. That’s where CRM comes into play.   
One of the industry leaders in CRM software, indisputably, is Salesforce. The company has over 100,000+ clients, and it changed the scope of CRMs when it introduced its cloud-based solution.    
Salesforce is a publicly traded CRM platform company helping many companies to stay on track with their customer bases. But that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s the right CRM for your company. 
We have discussed its pricing for small businesses to help you discover Salesforce for small businesses is a yes or no; keep on reading! 
Breakdown of costs associated with Salesforce for small business 
Here is the complete breakdown of Salesforce pricing that will be helpful in understanding the various costs involved when planning to go for Salesforce. 
1. Subscription costs
Salesforce is a cloud-based software solution that comes with varied pricing plans. Check out the table below for the pricing plans to discover Salesforce pricing for small businesses.  
Plans Pricing (USD/user/month (When billed annually)  Best for Essentials $ 25 Small businesses with 10 users. Professional $ 75 Best for any mid-size team Enterprise $ 150 Customizable CRM with all key features Unlimited $ 300 A smart solution for Marketing and Sales 
Note: Pricing is subject to change. 
The Salesforce essentials plan is dedicated to many small business owners. But, unfortunately, Salesforce essentials doesn’t have features like Workflow Automation, Pipeline and forecast management, sales engagement and insights, etc.
However, when adopting a CRM, small businesses must look for features like automation and sales reports that help them grow in no vain. 
So, the question arises, Is the Salesforce essentials plan worth the cost for small business owners?
Well, Automation, Sales Reports, and sales forecasting are some key features for everyone (enterprise, mid or small businesses) that shouldn’t be compromised, but Salesforce offers these features with their most popular, Enterprise plan. 
If your small business needs features like automation and sales forecasting reports but wants these at an affordable budget, you must look for Salesforce alternatives.

2. Setup and customization costs  
Depending on your business goals and needs, you can customize your Salesforce standard plan. You work out with multiple apps as it offers a 3rd part integration to accomplish varied tasks within CRM.
So, apart from the subscription cost, there are customization costs. Plus, other costs, like integration, training, and data migration as well. All those customizations have an additional cost that will be better explained by Salesforce consultants.
Though the software is serving billion dollars revenue-making companies, for small businesses, these customization costs can be an over-budget deal.
3. Maintenance and support costs 
Small businesses with limited budgets ensure the best service at affordable prices. Salesforce is a smart tool but has hefty pricing, so even if small businesses go for a Salesforce essentials plan, it costs them $300 with other additional costs. Hence, it will eventually impact your budget monthly or yearly. 
Salesforce is undoubtedly one of the most powerful CRM systems, but it could be more competent in supporting small businesses.  
Your small business needs all features to be unstoppable and at an affordable price too.

Is your CRM worth the cost for your small business?

Affordability is one of the most significant factors for businesses when deciding which CRM to use. Every business wants to get its money’s worth out of all the specific tools they need for its operation.
Therefore, you want a customer-centric CRM to manage your customer data at the best price. 
While Salesforce definitely has thousands of customers that are completely satisfied with their product.
But the chief complaint is that it’s just not affordable for small businesses and not even for mid-size ones.   
At about $25 per month per user, you can see why Salesforce may be out of the price range of many businesses.
That’s why you need to spend some time and research deciding if the CRM you are using is worth what you are paying for it.   
There are some key aspects you should consider when you are analyzing whether or not you are getting what you pay for in your CRM.
1. Which CRM features do you really need? 
Most CRMs these days have a long list of features, including everything from sales tracking and pipeline management to email tracking and Data Entry Automation and everything in between.  
Ensure you are getting the features you need but not paying for those you don’t use. Small business owners with high aims must research and compare various CRM platforms before picking anyone.
However, every feature that can reduce mundane time-consuming tasks is a positive sign in your CRM.
2. Is your CRM customizable?  
Advice from Business News Daily: “CRM platform encompasses so many areas of a business that customization is key to getting the most out of your investment”.  
Choose a CRM that you can customize according to your business’s unique needs. For instance, some options offer different packages based on the included features, whereas some let you select only the features your business requires. 
Customization can also expand capabilities using extensions, plugins, themes, templates, and add-ons to tailor the software to your business altogether. 
3. Is your CRM scalable? 
It’s the hope of every owner that their business grows and their bottom line continues to increase. Make sure that your CRM has the ability to grow with the business.  
The ability to grow means small businesses that are leveraging a CRM must have the option to upgrade smoothly with the software.
4. How accessible is your CRM? 
A company that offers business product comparisons says this about accessibility: “CRM solutions that can only be used in the office is no solution. Data must be entered into it from all manner of locations at trade shows, at customer sites, from partners’ premises’ and a dumbed-down version of the solution can’t handicap remote workers.’’  
Small businesses must look up cloud-based CRM as it is an investment for a growing business.
There are various cloud-based software solutions available out there. So, explore the tool well to check its features, functioning, and accessibility.

{"prompt": "Tracking sales performance: 5 Reports that you should be tracking already!", "completion": "From 179 sales leaders interviewed by The Brooks Group for the Sales Leadership Report 2020, only 31% of sales managers said that they had strong confidence in their sales team’s ability to achieve key business objectives. 
That means 69% of managers weren’t sure about their sales team’s performance.  
That is a drastic number! But what can you do to change that?  
This is where sales performance tracking changes the game.  
Our aim for this article is to understand the importance of sales performance tracking and find the right reports that will help you predict the success of your team. 
4 primary benefits of tracking sales 

1. Discover problems at an early stage 
Sales performance tracking keeps you updated on any alterations in the existing process. This helps you to detect problems at an early stage and strategize accordingly. 
Ultimately, sales tracking is similar to taking a precaution than a cure.  
For example, you have a sales funnel dashboard in your CRM, and you notice a significantly lower percentage of leads moving toward the middle of the funnel from the top of the funnel stage. 
In such a scenario, you can take the necessary steps, like focusing more on customer engagement or altering the strategy, etc., to ensure that the problem gets solved.  
This way, sales performance tracking can help you prevent future blunders by detecting problems at an early stage. 
Here are some more examples of predictions you can make based on sales performance tracking: 

You have a healthy demo booking, but the demo completion rate is very low. That shows your prospects are booking the demo but not joining on time. You can solve this problem by automating a simple email prior to the demo time. 
The total number of no-show demos is high, but the rescheduling of demos is very low. That means your prospects are missing demos in the first place and not booking the demos again. Maybe you can give a phone call and text message with a calendar link when prospects miss their demo. To increase the chances of reschedules.  
If the demo requests per day are declining, you can connect with the marketing team to find out the problem. Maybe there has been a significant impact on the website traffic. Or you simply need to push the demo booking more on your website.  
If the demos attended by an individual rep is declining, you need to invest more time in training the rep. Work with them and shadow a few calls to truly understand the problems they are facing.  
The report on “Deals in pipeline by sales reps” shows you the true impact of individuals on the bottom line.

2. Works as an alarm clock 
Sales is all about timing.  
Your sales reps have to reach prospects, communicate, and close – all at the right time. 
There’s an obvious chance your reps may miss out on important leads.  
And this is where sales performance tracking enters the picture. 
It provides real-time updates that work as a reminder for your team’s deadlines.  
For example, a report on “Deals in pipeline by stages” will show you where exactly the block is. In order to meet targets, you can get a clear idea of where your team should spend time communicating. 
For example, prospects in the ‘Decision’ stage are more likely to convert than the ‘Consideration’ stage. 
Hence, sales performance tracking works as an alarm clock that lets you measure the gap between the set goal and the achieved target of the entire sales team.  
3. Helps in the decision-making process 
It is vital to optimizing your strategy at specific intervals.  
This can be done only when you have a reliable progress report of the implemented strategy. 
Sales performance tracking allows you to measure the efficiency of each stage.  
Further, it helps you avoid useless activities that are not contributing to your success. 
For example, reports on sequences show the performance of each email with clear sales metrics. If you find out the last email of your sequence has only a 2% open rate, you can either get rid of it or optimize the subject line a bit.  
Of course, this was just a small example, but sales tracking can help you with much bigger decisions – even finalizing your ideal channel of communication. 
4. Provides real-time sales insights 
Sales tracking can offer the following insights in real-time: 

Who is leading the sales leaderboard in your team? 
Who has the most contribution in revenue this month? 
Who has the highest commission earned? 
Which sales rep has the highest assistance rate in deal closing? 
Which sales reps are closing deals without any assistance? 
What does your revenue donut look like? 
What are the top industries from your sales closure? 
Who had the greatest number of calls in a day, week, or month?

5 sales performance tracking reports that tell you everything about your team 

1. Activity-based sales report 
One of the simplest ways to measure the performance of sales teams is to track the different activities and their outcomes. 
So this would include sales metrics like the number of calls/texts made, email outreach, follow-ups, scheduled meetings, and much more. 

Keeping track of the number of outreaches done by specific sales reps and their progress is also helpful. 
It would certainly help you… 

Recognize the star performer of the team 
Identify the rep who needs a helping hand  
Discover the activities that consume the maximum amount of time 

These details help you improve your sales process and enhance training programs. 
2. Sales goal tracking report 
Goals are an inevitable part of sales. Quarterly or yearly goals are decided based on the data of past few years. 
This is where Sales Goal Tracking helps. With this metric, you can measure specific sales goals. This tool lets you track the distance between your accomplished and set goals. 
You can measure the gap between your weekly, monthly, and quarterly sales and revenue target.

3. Pipeline-based tracking report 

Sales pipeline reports help you understand deal movement throughout the sales process.  
This report lets you identify the real-time progress of deals.  
You can determine… 

The percentage of open opportunities moving to the next stage 
The sales cycle length 
The stage where most of the deals get stuck, and so on. 

This is used to understand the deal status and identify a proper deal distribution.  
Based on the insights, you can identify the main roadblocks and create strategies to ensure streamlined sales pipeline. This is how a pipeline report could look like: 
4. Opportunity win rate reports 
The formula is simple if you want to calculate the win rate for a particular time frame. 
Win Rate: Opportunities Won / Opportunities Generated   
This report helps you analyze various essential factors, like the efficiency of lead nurturing activities, the effectiveness of the sales process, and many more. 
By calculating opportunity win rate, you can observe which rep has outperformed and which rep needs more resources and guidance. 
5. Deal lost report 
This is a crucial report because it shows the top reasons why you’re losing deals.  
When a sales rep marks a deal as “Lost”, the CRM asks for a specific reason for failure. 
This report intelligently collects the data and turns it into insights for you. 
Such reports are likely to give you the following insights: 

What is the number one reason for losing deals? Is it related to a product, or is it related to salespeople? 
What can you do immediately to make a positive impact? For example, if the number 1 reason for your deal loss is “Lack of Product Education”, the next best thing is training. If the reason is “Picked a competitor”, you can do detailed research on it and find probable benefits of your product again the competition.

{"prompt": "How to build a cohesive sales outreach strategy?", "completion": "Key TakeawaysYou can create a cohesive sales outreach strategy for inbound and outbound. Find out how!Salespeople end up 50% of their daily time on emailing, data entry, and scheduling calls.You can find out parts that you can easily automate in your sales outreach.
Hear me out. 
Salespeople spend only one-third of their day actually talking to prospects. 
I mean, as a sales professional, you should be spending at least half of your day talking about sales. 
So, what exactly eats up sales reps’ time? 
The statistics say… 

Emailing (21%) 
Data entry (17%) 
Prospecting & researching leads (17%) 
Internal meetings (12%) 
Scheduling calls (12%) 

I can see three tasks you can completely automate, sparing you 50% more time every day! Now, think for your entire sales team!
What you need is a well-thought sales outreach strategy (and the power of automation). 
That’s the topic of our discussion today.  
What is a sales outreach strategy? Why should you care about it? and why you NEED to automate as much as you can. 
What is a sales outreach strategy? 
Sales outreach strategy is the planning of how your sales team will communicate with prospects throughout the customer journey. 
Basically, every communication from prospecting to sales closing will fall under this outreach plan.  
75% of B2B brands witness a whopping 4 months to acquire a new customer. A relatively older statistic, but the average sales cycle has increased by 24% from 2012 to 2014.  
Don’t you think, as we progress, our sales cycle should get shortened? 
Well, market dynamics are definitely not in our control, but how you outreach and pivot is definitely in your control. 
Our aim for this article is to minimize our cycle and automate different parts of sales outreach. 
Types of sales outreach 
As we all know, salespeople communicate with two mindsets: 
Inbound sales outreach: The prospects come to you and show interest using various digital mediums. 
Outbound sales outreach: You reach out to prospects with a calculated guess that they might be interested in your product/services. 
The main difference between inbound and outbound sales is that, in inbound sales, most sales efforts start at a later stage of the journey, while outbound sales start at an early stage.  
5 Steps to create a cohesive sales outreach strategy
Our goal is to create a strategy that you can use for inbound and outbound both.
You know there are some common parts in inbound and outbound. We want to identify exactly those parts, and automate them!
These are the steps where you can create a successful sales outreach strategy and execute it well, whether it’s for inbound or outbound:

Define where you need automation and where you need manual communication 
Create reusable templates 
Set up automation for repetitive outreach 
Experiment with various templates 
What else can be automated in inbound and outbound outreach? 

Step 1: Automation or manual communication? 
The first step to an effective sales outreach strategy is to know where exactly you want to leverage automation and where you want to use personalized communication. 
If you manage to find these items, you can create a solid plan for yourself, no matter inbound or outbound.  
The next question should be – Is there any common communication occurring in inbound and outbound both? 
You should automate them. 
These are some of the most common communications occurring in both cases:  

Product/service education communication 
Nurturing emails to push prospects down the funnel 
Follow-ups to book a meeting 
Welcome or onboarding emails once prospects signup for a free trial 
Confirmation emails for a product demo  
Pricing related communication 
Contract overview communication 
Account sales communication to provide better services 

All these tasks can be automated if you have a streamlined business process.  
There are some communications where automation is not possible. For example, discovery calls in outbound or negotiation phone calls.  
But you can still leverage automation, partially.  
Step 2: Create re-usable templates 
Once you figure out the parts you need to automate, create email templates for them. 
Invest heavy time in these templates. They are your assets.  
These assets are going to save you a lot of time for you, so test them before putting them in the process.

Step 3: Set up automation for repetitive outreach efforts
The next stage is to set up automation for all the repetitive communications. 
You need to be very careful with the triggers, conditions, and actions. 
These are some of the examples of sales automation you can use here. 
Trigger Condition Action If new deal is created If deal is moved to “Interested” stage Send a product education email with resourcesIf deal is moved to “Book a meeting” stage If Tag is equal to “Demo” Send an email with calendar link to book a meeting  Send a text message with calendar link Activity of “Demo” is marked completed If Tag is equal to “Demo Done” Send a thank you email and a text If deal is moved to “Closing” stage of the pipeline If Tag is equal to “Plan 1” or “Plan 2” Send pricing information email 
There are tons of sales outreach tools in the market. But I’d suggest you pick a platform very carefully.
You simply can not spend enormous amounts of dollars on sales outreach tools. So pick one that offers much more than outreach.
Salesmate is absolutely that kind. It’s a CRM. It’s an automation platform with sales and marketing journey creation capabilities.

Step 4: A/B test with various templates 
Once you set up the automation, now your job is to further improve your own process.  
Experimenting with various email and text templates can be life-changing for you. Even experimenting with subject lines can help you improve the process.  
According to statistics, subject lines with numbers in them got an open rate of 20%, while emails without numbers got only 12%. 
In Salesmate, you can simply add a small A/B Split Action Button to your journey and start experimenting.  
Step 5: What else can be automated inbound and outbound? 
Till this point, we only talked about communication that was common in both practices. But individually, there are certain items that you can automate.  
Let’s find out.

6 Sales outreach tactics to enhance your overall strategy 

1. Have a highly-targeted buyer personas
It is proven that having buyer personas help you perform better in your sales outreach. And so, you may already have a buyer persona in your sales outreach guide. 
What I want you to understand is – just having a buyer persona won’t be as effective as having a highly targeted buyer persona. 
Have a checklist of your ideal customer profile. Be specific with this profile. Do not have generic or trivial pointers. Instead, have precise and meaningful concerns about your buyer persona. 
Consider their responsibilities, type of work, daily activities, goals, and so on. These pointers will help you know your target audience in a better way. 
2. Optimize your outreach channel 
The practice of selecting the correct outreach channel is very known and helpful.  
While selecting the right channel, you may consider answering questions like: 

Which channel is actively used by the target audience? 
Which channel is best for my outreach for various stages of the sales pipeline? For example, calling is amazing when you’re dealing with cold leads. But for a warm lead, email would also work. 
Which channel can help you deliver information in the best way? 
Can you combine multiple channels for better results? For example, you can send an email along with a text message for conformational communication. 

These questions can surely help you discover your finest outreach channel mix. What enhances it – is using automation to improve your sales outreach. 
Whether you choose calling, text messaging, emailing, or any other mode of communication, you can always enhance it by shifting it to auto-pilot. 
With the help of a Sales Automation Platform, you can not only save your time but also level up your sales outreach game.

3. Have a highly personalized outreach 
You don’t sell the product or service; rather, you make the customer believe you’re here for them with the required solution.
To win this trust, you need to make your target audience feel heard and understood. 
You must focus on delivering tailored and thoughtful content. To do so, you should start adding the required personal touch to your communication mode. 
Whether you’re sending a message or an email, ensure you personalize the same using efficient software. There are various tools that allow you to personalize your outreach.
However, I would suggest a tool that offers multiple personalization features along with automating your outreach.

So with Salesmate, you easily automate your entire outreach process and close deals faster.

4. Leverage sales cadences 
Here’s another unique way to improve your sales outreach.
You are well aware that follow-up is an inevitable part of every sales process. You have to connect multiple times with your prospects to turn them into paying customers. 
However, it is essential to understand the slight difference between following up and annoying your prospect. 
You need to ensure that you effectively plan your follow-ups. You should know the best time and day to talk to your prospects. 
For instance: 

You should follow up with your prospects during the daytime. 
Send most of the emails at the start or during the mid-week and not on weekends. 
Send the sale, offer or event invite 2-3 days before the event and not on the same day or too early. 
Choose the right channel while following up with a prospect. 

And so on. Along with scheduling the follow-ups, you should even draft the content accordingly. For instance, you should plan the quality of the content. This includes strategizing the subject line, the CTA option, the opt-in/out option, and so on.  
All these qualities help you improve the efficiency of your sales cadence. Moreover, one of the best ways to optimize your sales cadence is to automate your tasks.  

Since follow-up is a recurring activity, you should focus on scheduling and personalizing your activities.  
You can easily optimize your sales cadence with the implementation of Sales Sequences. So, go ahead and try it yourself. 
5. Align marketing and sales teams  
This is a very smart way of improving the sales outreach process.  
Sales outreach activities are very similar to those of marketing tasks. After all, sales outreach is similar to advertising your business to your prospects. 
And so, involving the marketing team would be a wise decision. Marketers can help you enhance your outreach content. They can do so by assisting or creating your email and social media content. At the same time, it helps you build a sales pitch that yields excellent results.  
Moreover, you could even ask them to help you with relevant analytics that can be used during the course of selling. This helps you to choose the best channel. 
For e.g. if your marketing team has good experience with campaigns, it means your target audience like email communication, and you can adopt the same in your sales outreach strategy. 
Further, to have a seamless alignment between both teams, you should adopt Shared Team Inbox. It serves as a common platform where all the team members can come together and work on common goals. 
This is how the alignment of the marketing and sales teams can improve your sales outreach strategy.
6. Centralize data  
Data is a crucial part of every sales process. This data includes vital details like prospects’ credentials, personal and professional information, and various other sales-related data. 
You must preserve the data in a centralized place. You should store the data in a place where it is easily accessible and confidential at the same time. In such a scenario, an ideal cloud platform like Salesmate is all you need.

Are you the solution provider or part of the problem” – Marlene BlaszczykSPIN Selling proposes there are four types of questions that can help in discovering customers’ problems and concerns.We will elaborate on the questions as we proceed.SPIN Selling is the brainchild of Neil Rackham. It is a sales methodology that’s based on 12 years of research and 35,000 sales calls.This effective sales methodology enables sales reps to create a healthy connection with potential prospects.Salespeople trained in the “SPIN” model showed 17% improvement in sales results.Here is the breakdown of SPIN Selling:S  —  SituationSituation questions help you understand the prospect and their current situation.Examples of situation questions:
How do you keep track of [X]?What process do you follow for [X]?How do you currently manage [X]?P  — ProblemProblem questions are highly effective as they encourage prospects to speak about the problems they have overlooked.Examples of problem questions:

The CHALLENGER Sale MethodologyThe main issue is that few businesses aren’t aware of their problems or despite knowing it, they choose ignorance.If businesses don’t face problems that require solutions – they won’t need you.Challenger Sale methodology helps in educating the potential prospects about their current problem.The crucial problems that prospects don’t value or aren’t aware that exist.You not only throw light on those problems but also show the prospects how your solution solves them.Get closer than ever to your customers. So close that you tell them what they need well before they realize themselves – Steve JobsIn Challenger Sale methodology, sellers tailor their approach as per the quantifiable outcome that prospects value the most. They offer a unique perspective and incite the buyer to take action. Sellers use their understanding of the prospect’s business to challenge their thinking and maintain control over the sales communication.Challenger Sale is a kind of “commercial teaching” where you:
Discuss the problem in a way that the buyer agrees to it.Provide insights that buyers hadn’t pondered over.Share your success stories where you resolved similar problems.Suggest behavioral changes that the prospect must adapt to solve the problem.Acquaint them to your solution and show how it aids buyers to adapt to those behaviors.For Challenger Sale to be successful, you need an incredible amount of domain knowledge and industrial expertise. You must offer what your competitors can’t match or present a solution that the prospect can’t overlook.3. MEDDIC Sales MethodologyIsn’t it demoralizing if you aren’t able to close the deal even after putting in tremendous time and efforts?The problem might not be in your selling techniques but in the customers whom you are selling to.You might be approaching the wrong people who don’t require your product.As per a study, salespeople with a quota of $1 million and an average deal size of $100,000 suffered a loss of $218,000 over the course of a year by pursuing the wrong leads and opportunities. – Insidesales.comMEDDIC is one of the effective sales methodologies that can save you from chasing bad sales leads. It helps focus your efforts towards better customer qualification.MEDDIC is a sales methodology that’s created for complex leads, built by Dick Dunkel and Jack Napoli.MEDDIC stands for:M  —  MetricsMetrics are quantifiable and measurable results that prospects hope to gain from your solution. It can be anything from cost savings to increase revenue or profits.These metrics help you in describing the economic benefits of your solution.Once you identify the metrics, you can prove how your solution can provide the best ROI.E  —  Economic buyerAn economic buyer is any individual who has the power to make a purchasing decision. He has control over the funds and, ultimately, the authority to take the final call for the deal.The MEDDIC approach encourages the sales reps to connect with the person who makes the final decision.Here are a few questions for finding out the economic buyer –
What is your role in the decision-making process?“If we come to a mutual agreement, is there anybody else that would need to be involved?”“Are you the sole owner of this project?”“Who is responsible for purchasing decisions in your organization?”D  — Decision criteriaHere you must understand the factors a prospect considers while making a buying decision.Discover their technical, legal, and commercial decision criteria.This helps you in deciding whether you can meet the prospects’ criteria or not.Knowing how prospects choose a product helps in tailoring your messages to capture their interest.D  —  Decision processThe Decision Criteria that we saw above tell you what factors are considered while making a company’s buying decision.On the other hand, the decision process tells you how is that decision made and followed through.It is the process defined by the organization to reach a purchase decision.Insight into a prospect’s decision-making process will decrease the chances of losing out on a lucrative deal.You’ll have a clear idea about what needs to take place on the company’s end to close the sales. So, you can work accordingly to meet those conditions.I  —  Identify pain-pointsNobody likes to experience pain, not even your potential buyers. Businesses seek a solution to combat pain points.To provide cent percent customer satisfaction, you must identify these business pain points and understand the cause. Only then will you be able to offer a solution and relieve the prospects from these pain points.Try to get as specific as possible while discovering the prospect’s pain.For instance.When you say that a company is losing money, it is quite a vague statement. Try to find the exact amount and reason for losing money. Like losing $20,000 due to slow production. This will help you in pitching your solution in a better and more compelling manner.C  —  ChampionFind the Champion – an influential person in the company who is affected by the pain is an ideal candidate.One of the ways to locate your champion is by determining who would benefit the most if the pain is mitigated.Such champions collaborate with consultants and vendors to resolve the pain ASAP! They work actively to get your product implemented. These champions understand you can help, so they support you.Having an insider of the company at your side assists in closing the deal.4. Conceptual Selling MethodologyWould you blindly make a heavy investment?Wouldn’t you be interested in knowing what the product will do for you?People tend to spend their valuable dollars on something that might benefit them.Businesses are interested in the ROI. They want a solution to their problem and to get their needs fulfilled.Conceptual selling is a sales methodology that encourages sellers to find out such customers’ needs and fulfill it. They try to convince potential prospects to purchase a concept (desired outcome) rather than the product.The Conceptual Selling approach helps you in understanding your potential buyers at a much deeper level. This sales methodology emphasizes customer-centric communication and helps you concentrate on results.There are three things you need to focus on while using this sales methodology:Getting information
Garner information about the buyer’s business.Find out their interests, challenges, and concerns.Discover the reasons behind those challenges and concerns.Giving information

{"prompt": "Lead generation ads: What, why, and how with examples", "completion": "Search engines used to be a huge channel for growing businesses. They didn’t have to invest heavily in ads and could still convert searches into potential buyers.  
But every year, I see the organic search evolving. Organic SERP results are more “information-driven”, making conversions much harder.  
It is obvious that businesses will turn to ads to generate leads, marketing, and advertising.
According to Statista, in five years(2019-2024), U.S. digital ad spending is forecasted to grow from 132.46 to 278.53 billion dollars.
These lead generation ads aim to make the prospect share their contact details by filling out the lead form and getting them in the lead bucket. There are various methods of running lead generation ads. 
Some platforms redirect the user to your website, while some platforms allow lead forms within the platform—for example, Instagram, LinkedIn, Google Ads, etc. However, practically what matters is the ultimate goal of making prospects sign up for the lead form. 
Let’s start with the basics. 
What are lead generation ads? 
Lead generation ads are digital advertisements that collect prospect data from various channels hoping to meet their primary goal of conversion.  
In simple words, lead generation ads are all digital ads that bring in new customers or prospects.  
These ads also aim to collect relevant contact information of people who clicks on your ads. Here’s an example of a lead generation ad for “lead generation ads”:  

When users click the CTA on the ad campaign, it directs them to a dedicated landing page/homepage, or a popup appears.  
Some platforms offer pre-populated information from their social media profiles. Usually, the prospects have to fill up the data in the lead generation forms by themselves. 
Lead gen ads make the signup experience more cohesive for the users; hence it observes a high conversion rate. 
5 Most popular lead generation ads channels 

Google Ads 
LinkedIn  
Facebook 
Instagram 
Twitter 

Why should you use lead generation ads? 
These are three key benefits enough to prove the efficacy of lead generation advertising offered to every growing business. 
1. Cuts down the signup process 
As we discussed, some lead ads avoid directing users to a website, and rather a popup appears, specifically on social channels. 
Users don’t want to leave the social platform and hinder their experience. 
Many prospects can find it daunting to feed information manually, especially if there are too many form fields. 
Such lead gen ads are perfect for speeding up this lead generation process. Also, these are beneficial when you don’t have a proper website in place. 
You can run these ads and collect prospect data directly. But you’d have to initiate the communication in this case.  
This is extremely useful for a small online store relying on an Instagram page and not having a proper website.  
2. Collect high-quality leads 
Lead generation ads are clicked mainly by people who are interested in the product or service you sell. 
These lead ads offer a higher conversion rate than other conventional lead generation tactics. 
The below example is of a lead generation ad for webinar signup. So, this ad only targets a specific demographic, helping you collect qualified leads. 

The quality of leads depends on how well you have optimized your lead ad.  
3. You don’t need a website 
As we discussed, some ads directly collect leads using forms. This is amazing for new businesses that have no websites. 
They can directly move forward with new leads while building their website and branding. Of course, in this case, businesses must first contact potential customers and take the deal forward. 
8 Tips & tricks to create impactful lead generation ads with examples
Though creating lead generation ads is a marketing team collaborative work, as an ads manager, the major responsibility of setting up successful lead gen ads is on your shoulder.
Here are some tips and tricks that you can try to extract the most benefit from your lead gen ad examples.
1. Ask questions that’ll help you understand your ideal customers 
Use custom questions to filter prospects. Get in touch with your sales team, and see if they wish to learn something specific about the leads being offered. 

When a prospect is asked specific questions that are aligned with their requirements, you will receive relevant information as answers. 
Also, this information can be reviewed by the sales teams, so they don’t ask the same questions repeatedly. 
These can be some sample questions for a car dealership lead ad: 

When are you planning to buy a car? 
What’s your budget? 
Will you need a car loan? 
When would you like to request a test drive? 

2. Integrate lead gen forms directly with your CRM 
Make sure that you integrate your lead gen form with a CRM. So, their data will be stored directly in the CRM whenever a visitor clicks on your lead ad and fills up the Web Form. 
Here are some of the benefits of using an integrated CRM. 

You won’t have to maintain spreadsheets, upload them using other tools, or download them manually from the ad platform. 
Once you have the lead enters to your CRM, you can truly leverage Marketing Automation to send onboarding emails or welcome messages.  
It helps you build your customer profile from the very first interaction. Your CRM will record every touchpoint of the prospect, from marketing to sales closing. 
Every data in CRM makes your ICPs better. 
It is much easier for sales teams to connect with prospects if leads are stored in CRM. 

If you pick a CRM like Salesmate, you can integrate any social platform and collect data using Zapier. This is a single data source for you and the entire team.

3. Analyze your user’s post-fill-out experience 
Some lead gen ads work best because they collect information on the same platform without driving them to your website.  
But that shouldn’t stop you from sharing your website and socials. 
Once the visitor is done filling out the form, you can provide options to visit specific feature pages or invite them to check out your YouTube channel. 
4. No distractions ad 
If you have noticed, all the paid ads have limited ways to distract you as a visitor.  
The reason is simple. 
Businesses are spending money per click; they WANT you to click where conversions are coming. 
That’s why, on many websites, the header and footer are not visible in the ad version of the copy. Instead, the user will have only one option to take action – Sign up! 
5. Use extra-ordinary visuals 
An image or video that best represents your products and services is a tried and tested way of getting a user to click on your lead generation ad. 
Let’s understand this with an example. 
HULU uses a rather dramatic approach with its CTA.

As you can observe from the above image how the design team: 

Uses contrast colors so the user doesn’t miss out on anything while skimming 
Emphasizes the CTA using the ‘Get the Disney bundle’ phrase 
Makes use of their wallpapers in the background to showcase what content a user can consume 
Tries to capture leads by offering access to multiple platforms that help users save money 

6. Distribute your budget accordingly 
You can promote your business globally to scale rapidly. 
But it can be overwhelming for your sales team to seek follow-up on such a massive influx of leads. Therefore, choose channels wisely and allocate the budget accordingly, which drives potential leads.
You can distribute your advertising budget across channels as per the goal you wish to achieve.  
For example, if you’re spending money across multiple channels. You can take historical evidence based on the performance of each channel and make the budget distribution accordingly.  
Let’s say Instagram and Facebook lead ads are small-sized tickets; you can spare a minimum budget here. Similarly, LinkedIn is quite costly but gives you large customers; you can spend a heavy budget over there. 
Budget allocation is a critical part of any marketing strategy. The data below reflects how businesses majorly rely on digital channels to allocate their marketing budget. 

7. Retarget users who have engaged with your ad previously 
There can be several reasons why a user starts an interaction with your ad but doesn’t complete the process. 
Many times, website visitors get distracted and end up leaving the page.  
The smart thing to do is to retarget such users with targeted ads and entice them to complete the action. 
8. Send personalized emails 
80% of potential customers are more likely to buy from a brand that provides a tailored experience. 
If you think about it, your future customers expect a personalized journey. And that’s exactly what you can do with their emails. 
Once visitors fill out their details, you can send them a personalized welcome email. In addition, you can create a highly personalized email for every ad source.  
You can easily do this using a marketing automation platform. Best if your CRM is also a Marketing Automation platform.
Not just welcome emails, but you can also set up lead nurturing campaigns. 
Pros and Cons of having lead generation ads 
Now, that you’ve learned so much about lead generation ads. I’m sure you’ve guessed the benefits of it. However, here’s a detailed section to help you understand the pros and cons of this ads: 
Pros of lead ads: 

A good option for businesses that have no websites yet. They can set up successful lead ads and build a potential customer list.
Higher lead quality, so you can truly see the ROI. 
They are scalable and easy to access. Users can view it while they are browsing on mobile or any device. This makes it flexible to use and results in success.

New marketers might face issues setting up a successful lead ads campaign and optimizing to the highest level to meet their campaign objective.
For bootstrapped startups, it can be costly to invest money in ads. They might need to pick limited platforms with a limited budget. 

Conclusion

Allocate ad spend budget wisely, plan your campaign, analyze results, and reinvest in implementing the new learnings.

And that’s what we’ll talk about today.  
This blog covers 8 powerful lead generation forms examples and discusses why they drive conversion to the business.  
Additionally, you can find top actionable ways to optimize your lead generation form to capture leads and improve your form conversion rates. 
What is a lead generation form? 
A lead generation form is an online form that captures prospects’ contact details, such as email, contact number, or any other personal details as per the company’s requirement. 
Businesses use web forms in numerous ways, but the ultimate aim is to capture information that you can leverage at a later stage in your sales process. 
The bigger picture is to know prospects from every angle possible, and their contact info is just one of the steps. 
Some common lead generation form examples are contact forms, customer feedback, registration, survey, meetings, and newsletter signup forms. 
See the image below to learn the various lead generation forms used by B2B and B2C businesses to grow their customer base with marketing and sales-qualified leads. 

Let’s begin with the real crux of the blog; lead generation form examples. 
8 Insightful lead generation form examples 
About 50% of marketers believe that inbound marketing strategies, such as online lead forms, are helpful in acquiring potential leads. Businesses use web forms to run their lead generation engines and make sales pipelines rich. 
Let’s begin with the best lead generation form examples of various brands and industries to get the best insights for more conversions. 
1. HyperOffice: Lead form to generate quality leads 
The foremost lead generation form example is from HyperOffice. With little tweaks, their contact us lead form stands out and helps them get more quality leads. Let’s know how: 

Highlights: 

HyperOffice has created a personalized question based on the customer’s inquiry intent. 
The question, “Which Product Are You Interested In?” with the drop-down list, made it easy for them to segment them based on their product interest.  
If the prospects have issues to discuss, the form has a “How Can We Help?” section. It helps the sales and marketing teams to know prospects’ pain points and solve them for better form conversion rates. 

Such kinds of forms can potentially help B2B businesses segment and identify sales leads for dedicated products (if you have multiple products). 
It’s also a great start to the lead qualification process. Marketing teams spend hours to qualify leads for individual products, and such filters save them enormous time! 
The above lead generation form was built using Salesmate CRM’s Web Forms.

The question, “How can our sales team help you?” is helpful for their sales team in preparing their sales pitch. 
Reflecting leading brands as their clients adds a trust factor. Slack has brilliantly used native brands based on your location. So if you’re from the US, you’ll see brands like Uber, Intuit, Target, etc. If you’re from India, you’ll see Swiggy, Zomato, Meesho, etc. 
In the same way, you’ll see a testimonial from a native brand.

InvoiceBerry has created a simple and amusing lead generation form with actionable copy, saying, “Sign up and start sending invoices now!”

6 tactics you can use while designing your lead generation form 

Create lead generation form design as per your design guidelines. I’d suggest you consult your design team for this task. 
Find the most suitable place for the lead gen form on the landing page. Make sure visitors don’t have to scroll to the end to feed their information. 
Use testimonials, client logos, USPs, and awards next to lead gen forms. These items highly motivate people to signup and provide social proof. They also add a trust factor, so you’ll see fewer bounce rates on this page.  
If you’re considering popups for digital lead generation, make sure to add a blur effect when the popup is activated. It gives visitors the illusion that they’re in the next stage of the process.  
Add an appropriate post-submission message when prospects fill out the lead generation form. Another interesting way is to share valuable resources they can read or give out links to your YouTube channel after the submission.  
Connect your lead generation form with a CRM. Most businesses collect leads, and they waste so much time jumping back and forth between tools.  

How to bring your lead generation forms data into CRM without losing so much money? 
I talked about the tight budget of marketing teams earlier, and I have a perfect solution for you. 
But let’s look at the core issue first – How to bring lead generation form data into CRM? 
There are multiple ways to do it: 

Integrate your lead gen form builder tool with your CRM. For example, if you use Gravity Forms, you can connect it with your CRM using their add-on. Remember, it may cost you more money based on subscriptions. 
You can export the data from these forms and send them over to sales manually. Who wants that? 
Or you can use lead generation CRM that also provides a built-in feature of web forms, just like Salesmate! 

Creating web forms in Salesmate is super easy!

You have all the modification options from CTA button text to custom styling of the form.  
Not just that, you can also define how you want to save captured data in Salesmate.  
You don’t have to give any effort after pushing the lead generation form live. Visitors will fill out the form, and Salesmate will keep adding this data to your list automatically! 
That’s not it! You can set up automation based on the collected emails also. For example, a welcome email or an introductory offer for new potential customers! 
All you have to do is create your web form in 7 easy steps: 

Head over to the ‘More’ section and select ‘Forms’.  
Click on the ‘Form’ button in the top-right corner to create a form.  
Edit the form’s details, such as form name, title, introduction, and the submit button text.   
Then, you can either utilize the pre-defined fields or add new ones to capture information that’s important to your business.  
After this, you can edit options like choosing the action after form-submission, enabling double opt-in, adding a privacy policy, enabling ReCAPTCHA, and more.  
To change the appearance of the form, you can edit the background color, form background & border color, buttons, and more. You can also change the appearance by using the option of custom CSS.  
Finally, if you wish to push the lead generation form live, hit the ‘Publish’ button or click on ‘Save’ to edit the form later.

{"prompt": "Sales volume variance: Definition, formula, and factors influencing", "completion": "Key TakeawaysSales volume variance is the deviation of actual units sold from the budgeted or standard units sold at a specific price within a specified period.Sales Volume variance= Actual units sold - Budgeted units sold x Price per unit.To measure your profit, use the absorption costing technique and to measure revenue, use the marginal costing technique.
Did you know that 93% of sales professionals cannot forecast their revenue up to 5% even when two weeks are left in the quarter? 
However, sales forecasting help leaders estimate their future sales revenue for a defined period. 
The revelation will help you plan your spending and suggest modifying your sales strategy to diminish fluctuations in lead flow, revenue and other influencing factors. 
Sales volume variance is one of the KPIs that contribute to sales forecasting. Therefore, knowing it is a mandate for accurate sales forecasting.
This blog talks about what is sales volume variance, the formula and how sales leaders can benefit from it to understand the business opportunity, sales and revenue. 
What is sales volume variance? 
Sales volume variance is the difference between actual units sold and the budgeted (or standard) units sold at a specific price within a specified period. 
It is sometimes referred to as “sales quantity variance,” as it is calculated based on the number of units sold. 
Sales volume variance formula explained with an example 
If you know the actual number of units sold compared to the budgeted units sold and the price per unit, calculate the sales volume variance using the formula below. 
Sales volume variance= [Actual units sold – Budgeted units sold] x Price per unit 
It is a measure that gives valuable insights into where your sales efforts are going. 
Let’s understand it with the help of an example: 
Let’s stick with our SaaS product example; now, you have projected that your sales team will sell 100 subscriptions in February. 
But, your team sold only 85 subscriptions, and each subscription is $15 per month.  
Now, let’s calculate.

The negative sign indicated an unfavorable variance(explained in the next section of the blog). 
Once you have your sales volume variance result, it helps you understand how to improve your sales performance by optimizing various impacting parameters. 
You can optimize product pricing and budgeted units count to achieve a favorable variance that directly leads to a tendency for higher profit. 
If all other variables remain equal, you should have a more accurate projection next month.  
Absorption costing vs. marginal costing 
There are two costing techniques, absorption and marginal costing, and you can implement either depending on your need. 
Find the specification in the table below: 
Absorption costing Marginal costing You need to consider both fixed and variable cost. (production & fixed overhead like salaries, property tax etc.)  You need to consider variable costs (raw materials, piece-rate labor, production supplies, commissions, delivery costs, etc.)  Takes net profit/unit during calculation  Takes standard contribution/unit during calculation  
Sales volume variance is important 
Sales volume variance measures where your budgeted profit is going, so it is a crucial sales KPI. In addition, it effectively contributes to helping leaders to make smart data-driven decisions.Understand how with an example. 
Let’s stick with our SaaS product example;  
The basic plan is worth $12, and the growth plan is worth $24 per user per month when paid annually. 
Suppose your reps sell 500 basic and 300 growth plan in one month. 
Financial analysis indicates that sales by the basic plan made $6,000 in revenue, and sales by the growth plan made $7200 in revenue.  
Revenue count expresses that the growth plan is more beneficial for the company’s success, so you should command your sales reps to pitch aggressively for a growth plan.  
But, the sales volume analysis brings us a different perspective on the business. It indicates that you have a larger audience that finds your basic plan useful for them as the company receives a new 500 subscription. 
Therefore, calculating sales volume variance opens new perspectives to your sales that will contribute to a promising sales strategy. 
In this competitive space, you must know whether your sales efforts are in the right direction or not! 
Sales volume variance analysis
Sales volume variance can be considered a sales performance meter that tells about your financial outcomes failing or exceeding, or meeting your budgeted sales. 
Check out the table below:
Favorable sales volume variance  Unfavorable sales volume variance  Your sales volume variance would be favorable when the actual sales quantity is more than the budgeted quantity. Your sales volume variance would be unfavorable when the actual sales quantity is lesser than the budgeted quantity. Actual unit sold > Budgeted unit sold Actual unit sold < Budgeted unit sold The value comes negative.The value comes positive.It indicated profit tendency.It indicates a loss tendency.
What are the key factors that affect sales volume variance? 
It is a potential sales performance gauge and is influenced by internal and external factors. So let’s dive deep in.
Internal factors External factors Performance of your sales reps  Seasonal impact  Changes in your sales process  Change in market trend  Change in your product pricing  Change in the competitor’s pricing  Planned supply chain alterations  Spontaneous supply chain alterations  
Internal factors 
There are four essential internal factors, as discussed below. 
1. Performance of your sales reps 
Sales managers can track the sales performance of their reps, such as calls made, deals converted/products sold, etc. 
Sales activity tracking is essential to identify why your sales reps’ performance is decreasing, and you can help them improve. 
For example, if your sales reps are making 40 calls per day, then just by increasing 5 calls per day for each rep, you can significantly impact your sales volume variance. 
If you get an unfavorable variance, you can start by assigning higher goals to your team and providing the right resources for execution. 
2. Changes in your sales process 
The sales process is one of the most apparent factors and majorly impacts your sales variance, finding sales opportunities, and meeting your sales quotas.  
So, you must identify the loopholes in your sales process and optimize them for better sales. 
For example, if most of your customers are not going forward with the purchase after looking at the features, then you need to find out whether your sales team is targeting the right prospects or not.  
Identifying roadblocks in the early sales process for a positive financial impact. 
3. Change in your product pricing 
Your product pricing must resonate with its value and help it win in its competitive space. If not, the change in your product price will affect the sales volume variance. 
For instance, if there’s a vast difference between your competitors and your product despite having the same features, you need to revisit your pricing strategy. 
Analyze your product prices, see if they’re providing the right values compared to the price and then finalize them.  
So, try to keep your product/service pricing stable to be on the profitable side.   
4. Planned supply chain alterations 
Variation in product quantity supply impacts your manufacturing cost and logistics. Therefore, it significantly changes your standard contribution unit and price per unit.  
Standard contribution per unit impacts the result of favorability and unfavourability.
In this case, you need to develop a supply chain process that requires fewer modifications and can withhold different requirements. 
External factors 
There are four essential external factors, as discussed below.  
1. Seasonal impact 
Businesses must take seasonality into account as it impacts their sales performance. 
There can be seasons/occasions that can get you higher sales, like Cyber Monday offers, New Year discounts, etc., in those months.  
You must understand your business’s natural cycle to avoid a drop in sales. Startups must take this factor into account seriously. 
Moreover, you can also analyze past trends and find out which month is the most profitable and which month you need your team to work harder. 
Seasonal trends are predictable, and you can modify them in your favour.  
For example, check out the past data for the trend. If December is not a good month, historically, fewer units were sold, so there is a high probability it will also not be good this year.  
In precautions to such a trend, the business will probably try to cover the ground in September and November if the sales reports history indicates that December is not a month of good sales. 
2. Spontaneous supply chain alterations 
A sudden change in the supply chain will have an adverse impact. 
For example, suppose your current supplier backs off. Now instantly finding a new supplier is challenging. Moreover, it will largely impact your costing; thus, measuring your standard profit variance would be difficult even with a favorable result.  
For this scenario, you need to create a database of different suppliers and resources that you can directly connect with whenever any such requirement arises. 
3. Change in market trend 
A fluctuation in market trends affects your sales count greatly. Therefore, it would help to look at your sales pipeline and prospects’ interest in your product. Always be active with the latest market trend and optimize your sales strategy accordingly. 
For instance, you have communication software as a product; suddenly, all your prospects start looking for live chat software more than calls for their customer services department. This can be a new market trend for you. 
  

Live chat software + CRM!Manage sales, marketing, and CX from a single platform!Explore Live Chat
In such a scenario, you can conduct an email campaign to know your existing customer’s responses about introducing this feature. For a favorable result, it is compulsive to watch out for the marketing trend. 
4. Change in the competitor’s pricing 
A decrease in your competitor’s pricing might trouble you as your customers probably switch to them. But, a raise in their pricing might get you an excellent opportunity to grow your sales.  
So, keep track of the fluctuation in your competitor’s pricing.

    </p>About the Salesmate studySalesmate conducted a study where we analyzed 80 companies varying across industries like Construction, Information & Technology, Real Estate, Digital Agencies, etc. The aim of this study was to find out the best day and time to make a sales call. In this study, we observed 12,480 call attempts spanned across 60 days (12 weeks with 5 working days). The calls were made by a total of 245 sales reps and the successful conversations were 1427. All the sales reps belong to the USA, and so do the prospects they connected with during this study. Let’s check out the findings.Best day to make a sales callAccording to the results, Wednesday is the best day to make a sales call with 136 successful call conversations on the very first attempt. Right after Wednesday, Thursday is the second-best day to make a call to prospects with 113 successful conversations. Friday would be the worst day to make a sales call with only 63 conversations. The difference in the number of conversations between the best day (Wednesday) and the worst day (Friday) is 53.67%.Make sales calls right from your CRMGet virtual numbers and start connecting with prospects!Try Salesmate for FreeBest time to make a sales callStarting from 9 am to 6 pm, in the evening between 4 pm to 5 pm would be the best time to make a sales call. The results also showed the worst time to make a sales call i.e. 5 pm to 6 pm in the evening. The second best time to make a sales call would be in the morning between 10 am to 11 am.The difference between the best time and the worst time to make a sales call is 88.88%.Response TimeIn this study, we also observed the response behavior of the prospects and we got some amazing results. The moment a lead is generated (or an inquiry is submitted), the first hour has the highest chances of conversation over a call. With 137 successful conversations in the first attempts, the study shows that the first hour from the lead generation is the most important hour to make a sales call. The number of responses drops drastically by 11 times from the first hour to the 8th hour of lead generation.In simpler words, the chances of having a successful conversation with prospects drop each hour after the lead is generated. ConsistencyIn this study, we have also made emphasis on the consistency of making sales calls to prospects. The number of attempts (or how many times to call a lead) made a lot of difference in the total number of conversations that took place (i.e. 1427).245 sales reps had a total of 489 successful conversations in the first attempt. In the second attempt, another 281 conversations took place. Interestingly, 328 more conversations were made in the third attempt by the sales reps. According to the results, sales reps managed to have conversations until the 6th attempt. In simpler words, for a prospect, it is advisable to make 6 attempts to have a successful sales conversation.Average call attempts by sales repsOut of 245 sales reps under the observation, only 29 have made a total of 6 attempts to a prospect. While we’ve already understood that a minimum of 6 attempts is advisable to reach a prospect, most sales reps give up on the third attempt. How Salesmate can help?Salesmate is a sales CRM designed for small and medium-scale businesses.

{"prompt": "6 Best lead scoring software you must consider in 2023", "completion": "Lead scoring is a significant element in building MQLs.  The qualification process starts when marketing teams get a hold of prospect data.  Then the lead is qualified based on various grounds and conditions.  Once that’s done, it is finally passed on to the sales team to get conversations going. Usually, the process is performed by marketers, however, there are businesses where this is done by sales teams.  It is completely subjective to your business process.  For models that collect numerous amounts of leads, the marketing team has to qualify and pass on the best quality of leads to sales team.  But in the SaaS model, businesses might have a mixed approach.  In Salesmate’s case only, sales and marketing teams collaborated and created the finest lead scoring model. So, for the sake of understanding, I’ll consider the lead qualification task as a marketer’s job.  Reports make it safe to say, that marketers are largely adopting lead scoring software as the industry shows a CAGR of 11.6%. So, my goal for this article is to suggest the finest lead scoring software in the market with its pros and cons.  But I’ll also try to share a thought process that would be extremely useful in the process consideration stage.I have tried to cover tools for various needs. So some of these platforms are proper lead scoring software, while others are much more.Choosing the best lead scoring software: A smarter approach Lead scoring is a part of the process and not the entire process. Initially, you capture leads and score them.  Further, you need to segment, route, nurture, and track these leads.  So, here’s a primary note: Lead scoring is a part of the lead qualification process.  Sales teams would still qualify leads based on the budget, needs, company vision, etc. And that’s the primary difference between MQL & SQL. Moreover, there is hardly any independent lead scoring software. And the ones existing are going to cost you a fortune.  So, why not consider the software that offers the best lead scoring feature along with other sales or marketing benefits? – That too at a very economical price. Here’s a table with an overview of the top 6 best lead scoring software.  These 6 lead scoring software are the best for each category. I have kept the price range very versatile so that you can decide yourself based on your affordability.  I think it would be self-evident which ones are the best lead scoring software for small, mid, and large-sized teams and enterprises. Software  PricingOther prominent featuresSalesmate  Pricing starts at $12/month   Marketing Automation add-on costs $30 for 1000 contacts for lead scoringAll-in-one CRM  Lead generation & nurturing features  Marketing Automation PlatformShared Team Inbox  Live Chat & Chatbots  Slintel Custom pricing model   (Sorry, I couldn’t find this!) Data enrichments  Integrations  Customization Act-On Pricing starts at $900/month for 2500 contacts Marketing Automation  Marketing Segmentation  Email Marketing Automation HubSpot Pricing starts at $800/month with 2000 contacts All-in-one CRM  Marketing Automation  Shared Inbox  Live Chat Keap Pricing starts at $129/month with 1500 contacts Marketing Automation  Lead Management  CRM Madkudu Pricing starts at $3499/month with 6000 contacts Marketing Operations  Account-based marketing I have taken the pricing plans where lead scoring as a feature starts appearing. 6 best lead scoring software you should absolutely try in 2023 Here’s a detailed explanation of every tool. And a precise table at the end of this section to help you make a better decision. 1. SalesmateSalesmate is a one-stop CRM software for all your sales, marketing, and customer success needs.  It serves as a platform that assists multiple teams in your business to automate the entire customer journey. You’ll get lead scoring as a part of the Marketing Automation Software of Salesmate. It offers everything from capturing, routing, engaging, scoring, and nurturing leads.  You can score leads using the drag-and-drop journey builder of Salesmate. I must tell you; lead scoring is just one of the use cases of the journey builder. You can practically automate a hell-lot of tasks that you don’t want to do manually. Journeys work on a simple rule of trigger-condition-action. Lead scoring is an action in this case. And we call it Salesmate Score. The journey builder allows you to set more than 45 triggers, conditions, and actions. So, you can truly build the lead scoring model that you want! You can depreciate the score when the number of days is useful in the conversation. Every team member can view this score in the contact profile picture.  Again, lead scoring is just one of the use cases. There’re hundreds of automation you can do and improve your productivity. For example, this is the journey of a newsletter campaign with multiple time zones: Let’s look at Salesmate as a whole quickly. Key additional features

Profile enrichment like emails, direct dials, company information, website, and LinkedIn profiles in just a few clicks CRM integrations with Salesforce, HubSpot, and Pipedrive Slintel collects technographic data that’s updated every 2 weeks Pros  
It lets you track the lead’s web activity and score them on similar grounds It relies on external factors to judge a lead, compared to other tools that rely on internal factors. That’s different. Cons  
The pricing is not available. In most cases like this, I have seen the product could be costly I also found the CRM integrations are very limited. So Slintel is quite fixated on what kind of customers they want (Probably mid-scale to enterprise) Some reviews reveal that their database isn’t accurate and needs improvement  Pricing No pricing is available. You need to get in touch with their team to know the real dollars.

1. Salesmate 
Best for businesses that want to bridge their sales, marketing, and customer experience teams
Salesmate is an all-in-one CRM and automation platform for sales, marketing, and customer success teams. A shared team inbox tool is one of the features of the platform.  
If you’re relatively new to what Salesmate can do, take a quick look at this video.
Let’s talk about the best shared inbox software inside Salesmate first. 
This is how it looks inside Salesmate. Quite simple and easy to use. 

For every email you receive, you can 

Select multiple followers that can follow the conversation 
Assign an owner of the conversation 
You, as a user, chose to follow the conversation 
Tag conversations for better segmentation 
Close conversations once they’re done 

You can fasten your work by simply choosing from your pre-made templates. 

All you need to do is pick the right template, make the necessary changes, and hit the send button! 
As I said, Salesmate is built for collaborative teams, and support teams often deal with salespeople. 
If you find conversations relevant to the ongoing deals, you can directly associate conversations with deals in just a few clicks. 
The conversation will reflect in the detailed view of that particular deal in Salesmate:

You can also associate your response with a new meeting. You can directly choose a time slot from your calendar and add the meeting details as a reply.  
Talking about internal collaboration, you can tag your team members and let them know how to respond to the conversation. 
This is super useful for internal chats or private notes or discussions.

2. Help Scout 
Best for teams looking for centralized communication solutions 

Help Scout is a customer communication platform where you can manage all your conversations in a single platform.  
Talking specifically about shared inbox software, Help Scout has covered everything necessary: 

You can assign conversations to a team or an individual 
Drop private notes to your team, as we saw in Salesmate 
You can save frequent replies and reuse them easily 
Tag customer conversations for better identification 

The good thing about Help Scout shared team inbox software is – it lets you see all the past conversations from the contact.  
In Salesmate, we call it 360° Contact view, where you can see every tiny detail associated with that contact. 
As I mentioned, you should look for something extra, so here are some other features from Help Scout that I find valuable. You should definitely check them out. 
Key features in spotlight

1:1 live chat for website and app 
Send in-app messages through beacons 
Build and maintain your own knowledge base 

Help Scout is a focused platform for conversation and messaging. 
If you’re looking for a platform that provides shared inbox software and other messaging solutions, you should try out Help Scout. 
Pricing

Standard – $20/user/month 
Plus – $40/user/month 
Pro – $65/user/month 

3. Front 
Best for teams that are looking to sort out their customer communications 

Front shared inbox tool comes with necessary needs like tagging teammates, assigning conversations, etc. 
The fun thing about Front is – it offers analytics for your shared inbox. You can track email behaviors, team performance, average response time, etc.  
Another good thing I found was rules inside the shared inbox. So, you can automatically sort conversations and drive them to the right person using certain rules.  
Besides shared inbox software, you can find the following features on this platform. 
Key features in spotlight

Create custom rules for inboxes 
Insights on team performance 
Front claims to connect all the communication channels like email, SMS, social media, WhatsApp, etc. 

In my opinion, Front is a simple tool for teams that want to resolve their customer communication and make it easy. It does not offer high-end automation (yes, Rules are there), but it’s easy to use and does what’s necessary.

Pricing 

Starter – $19/user/month (Minimum 2 users required)

Scale – $49/user/month (Minimum 10 users required) 

4. Hiver
Best for teams that enjoy the Gmail interface and want to manage shared inboxes from the same 

Hiver is a Gmail shared inbox and helpdesk software facilities.
Talking about the shared team inbox software, Hiver has all the usuals. 
You can assign conversations, save canned responses, and set up auto-assignment.  
However, I found collision detection quite interesting. Basically, if two team members are responding to the same conversation, it gives you an alert. That’s pretty cool. 
Hiver also lets you edit the response collaboratively. So you can structure the best answer for your customers.  
Besides the shared inbox, we get the following values from Hiver. 
Key features in spotlight

Create basic rules to assign conversations to the right person 
Enable round-robin email management 
Live chat software for web visitors 
Manage your own knowledge base  

Hiver is a Gmail-based customer communication platform. If you’re too comfortable with Gmail and want to continue with the same interface, you should definitely check out Hiver. 
Pricing 

Lite – $15/user/month  
Pro – $39/user/month 
Elite – $59/user/month 

5. Helpwise  
Best for teams that aim to bring all the communication channels under one platform 

Helpwise is a help center software aiming to bring all the communication channels under one platform.  
This tool assists you in having a unified platform where you can manage multiple channels like emails, social media, Slack, WhatsApp, etc. 
Bringing social media messages is always useful because customers reach on multiple channels these days.
It’s quite a popular concept, and I love the fact that Helpwise offers 50+ integrations with various CRM, telephony systems, and task management tools.  
Talking about the shared inbox platform, Helpwise has tried to keep the interface like email clients for relatable UX. That’s quite useful for most people.  
Its shared inbox tool provides usual features like tagging, assigning, and analytics.  
Just like Hiver, Helpwise also offers collision detection to avoid duplicate messaging.  
Key features in spotlight

Live chat widget for web visitors 
Set up CSAT surveys in inboxes for quick customer feedback 
Create and maintain your own help center for articles and resources. I love the fact that Helpwise has offered SEO options, so your help articles can also bring new traffic 
Distribute conversations with automation rules

  

Turn web visitors into high value prospectsPower up your website with Salesmate Live Chat Software.Explore Live Chat
Helpwise is useful for multiple teams, but I think the tool is created specifically for customer service teams.  
The keyword is “communication” here. I would put Helpwise in the same categories as Front and Help Scout.  
Pricing 

Free for limited team 
Premium – $20/user/month 
Advanced – $40/user/month 
Enterprise – Request quote 

6. Gmelius  
Gmail-centric tool with shared inboxes, labels, and Kanban board 

Another Gmail-centric shared inbox tool in the town like Hiver.  
Gmelius is a team collaboration platform with shared inboxes, shared labels, and Kanban boards.  
Again, the purpose is quite clear. It’s centered around people who find Gmail very dear. 
Besides the usual tagging, assigning, and saving email templates, it has an interesting feature of shared labels.  
Here, you get to share Gmail tags with the team. Tags can be anything – projects, departments, stages, processes, etc. 
Key features in spotlight

Kanban view in Gmail can be exciting for some users to manage pipelines, processes, or tasks. However, there are free plugins to turn your conversations into tasks in Gmail 
You can integrate this Kanban board with Trello. That’s extremely useful for a majority of users 
Gmelius comes with workflows, and one of the use cases is sequences.  
In Salesmate, we have kept these two features separate. We noticed that customers prefer task automation and communication in separate ways. 
That’s why Workflows are for minor task automations, and Sequences are dedicated to automated follow-ups in Salesmate. 

I think Gmelius is a simple tool for people who like Gmail. But I always feel platforms that depend on other tools (like Gmail, in this case) have limitations.  
Pricing 

Plus – $12/user/month 
Growth – $24/user/month 
Pro – $49/user/month 

7. Missive
Best for teams looking for a communication-centric platform

The last one on the list is Missive. A simple tool heavily focused on communication.  
Interestingly, this is the only tool in the list that offers internal team chat. Missive covers other channels like SMS, WhatsApp, Socials, etc. 
I appreciate that Missive has focused solely on communication and tried to cover the maximum ground.
They have built ample small features to support communication and make it more user-friendly. 
Key features in spotlight

Internal chat for quick resolution 
Canned responses 
Collaborative writing 
Workload distribution in 4 different ways 
Workflows for basic automation 
Live chat for web visitors 

I think Missive is specifically built for customer support teams. There are tiny communication-driven features that you’d appreciate, but it’s all related to communication, nothing else. 
Pricing

Starter – $14/user/month 
Productive – $18/user/month 
Enterprise – $26/user/month

Hence, you must experiment with a few strategies and approaches to find the right one.1. Landing page copywritingIn terms of online marketing, a landing page is also known as –
Single property pageStatic pageLead capture pageDestination pageA standalone page that lands a user from a link on a digital channel or email. Its main objective is to get a visitor to open a conversation with your business.To achieve this, one can interlink eBooks, whitepapers, and datasheets or add CTAs in their blogs, guest posts, videos, and more.A prospect can access the same in exchange for their personal information such as email, phone number, and company name.In a nutshell, a trade-off between the prospect and the company.Landing pages differ from other website pages as they’re designed as a part of a more extensive marketing campaign.Hence, it’s important to prioritize the end goal and set up your content.Example:Calm is a SaaS health and wellness app that covers everything one can explore with its landing page.The headline “Meet Calm” instills a feeling of tranquility just by reading it. The other things that stand out about the landing page are:

Free/Paid trial or demosFree trials or demos are among the best-performing CTAs for B2B lead generation.A free trial is a limited-period offer for prospective customers to try your product or services.Companies that want to target qualified leads also use paid trials.A free demo assists a user in understanding a service or product compared to what they currently use. This tactic can help in generating leads and improve your customer base.For example, Salesmate offers a 15-day free trial without seeking a payment commitment.One can also schedule a demo to learn about the product features and how it can grow your business.So, a prospect can simply get a 15-day free trial and see if Salesmate is the right fit for their business.3. Live chats & chatbotsAn average user spends about 15 seconds on a webpage. So, your business has to make an impression in these 15 seconds or less.This is an ideal way to learn about your users and help them find what they want.Chatbots can be used to spur conversation, and once you learn what they’re looking for, they can be switched to live chats.Live chats offer a human-to-human connection, while chatbots set the tone and connect users with the right personnel.Example:Are you looking for a chatbot that –

Scheduler/CalendarBusinesses generally break down their development in quarterly, half-yearly, or yearly cycles.  To achieve the same, one has to plan activities in advance, using functional scheduling software or a calendar app.Scheduling software can be used to manage your internal and external tasks. Here are some of the use cases of a Meeting Scheduler.
Help your prospects by allowing customers or clients to schedule meetings from your web or landing page.Schedule free demos, training sessions, or webinars, and remind users about the same.Plan interviews, assignment deadlines, and other HR activities for your candidates and employees.Plan and track events for your marketing and sales campaigns.Observe a higher success rate with your scheduling software by automating your emails.Example:Schedule.cc is one of the finest examples of the convenience a scheduling assistant can introduce to your daily routine. Schedule.cc helps you schedule intelligently using its AI-enabled personal assistant. A virtual assistant that saves you money and time by learning your preferences and scheduling appointments for you.5. Web formsWeb forms are the bedrock for inbound marketing. Various types of web forms are designed for specific purposes.Usually, to acquire user information and offer something in return.  Here are different types of web forms that you can try. 
Registration/sign up forms Order/purchase formsFeedback formsMembership formsFree trial/demo formsContact formsExample:A web form works best in tandem with your SaaS product or service.  Below is an example of the Salesmate’s Web Form, which helps you capture data right inside the CRM. Moreover, you can also check which page is bringing in more leads and conversions.6. AdvertisementsAds are like veterans for every marketing strategy. No matter how much we hate consuming ads, it can be an effective lead generation tool if used wisely. They serve a company by collecting important data about their users.For example, if one searches the query ‘buy headphones under $1000,’ they can be targeted with relevant ads on YouTube, Instagram, and other social channels.Facebook and Google are A-players when it comes to lead gen using ads.They help businesses inculcate a deeper understanding of their users, discover potential clients, provide high-granular analytics, and increase conversion rates.Example:Most people like LinkedIn as a platform to help connect with the right professionals.  Which it is!But it’s used by more than 650 million people. And this makes it a perfect platform for advertisements.It’s the need of the hour that a business offers a seamless mobile experience to its users.LinkedIn portrays how they have excessively worked to create a functional mobile and desktop experience.We observed above is a classic example of how LinkedIn prompts new users to try its platform with advertisements.7. Coupons, offers & discountsNo matter how wealthy you are, getting something for free or at a discounted price always makes you feel special.A marketing offer is when a business offers a service or product for free or at a discounted price.For instance, if Amazon plans to offer a 10% discount on its selected products on Good Friday.They can share a coupon code ‘GoodFriyay10’ on their website, app, and other social media platforms.Apart from this, you must be aware of the offers and discounts apparel companies give, calling it ‘the end of season sale.’ This can be a successful lead generation campaign and can also help improve revenue.Example: Observe how Shoes.com creates a mystery with its flash sale campaign.You love it the moment you set eyes on it. Even if you don’t plan to make a deal, you are curious to learn what deal you might get.  Also, the bright-colored CTA is a bulls-eye that stands out in contrast with the black backdrop.8. Email marketingEmail marketing offers the highest ROI of all the different lead gen tactics marketing teams use.You can offer ungated content such as a free trial, demo, eBooks, whitepapers, and more to engage with your prospects and convert them into leads.Once a prospect offers their email, you can send a welcome email and eventually start with lead nurturing activities.Remember, timely follow-ups can very well convert a prospect into a qualified lead and, eventually, a customer.Therefore, one must be selective with their direct mail. One can surely invest more time in the attachment they send with the email. 

Create impactful email marketing campaignsSalesmate gives you detail insights of how your prospects are engaging with your emails.Explore Email Marketing AutomationExample:Wayfair, an online home goods company, works with the United States Postal Service.  When a citizen requests an official address change and receives a confirmation letter in the email, it includes a 10% off coupon for Wayfair purchases.A perfect place to meet your client just when they’re thinking about shifting to another place.9. RemarketingRemarketing is a marketing tactic that targets users who have already visited your website. It aims to educate users who are already aware of your brand.  Your marketing campaigns might generate a lot of impressions but have a low conversion rate.This is because your users might want to learn more about your business. Remarketing helps you to reengage with those prospects.A thumb rule for every paid marketing campaign you launch is to have a remarketing campaign as a safety net.Example: Have you bought your Spotify premium yet? One of the best examples of remarketing for music lovers is Spotify.If you observe: 
Spotify’s design team has nailed this poster with the perspective it offers and the choice of colors.The concentric placement of headphones clearly speaks volumes for the message they wish to convey.The poster clearly emphasizes the ‘3-month free’ phrase by reversing the colors of its font.We must appreciate the creativity they infuse while they’re annoying you to buy their premium subscription.10. Affiliate marketingIn simple terms, affiliate marketing is commission-based earning by promoting other people’s products or services.This process comprises two individuals, i.e., the retailer or advertiser and the affiliate.  A simple rule is an affiliate only earns a commission when a lead is converted into a customer.  Affiliate marketing offers high returns while investing less effort. Your business would be available to a large audience instead of targeting individual customers.Also, learning about a product or service from a trusted individual can effectively increase your sales.Example:Skillshare, an online education portal, offers various courses on business management, photography, and visual arts.  Their affiliate program attracted a lot of attention due to its promotion by many social media personalities on their channels.11. Competitor comparison pagesCompetitor comparison pages are a great strategy to convert bottom-of-the-funnel leads into customers.It helps them understand if they’re a right fit for your product or service instead of adding customers that’ll eventually fall out. Remember, the aim behind creating these pages is not just to promote your competitors in a negative light. Or only portraying how your product or service is superior.  It’s to offer exact and notable differences that help a lead connect with the right business and vice versa.Creating competitor comparison pages has become a necessity for businesses. They’re developed to have a say in how your product or service is better than your competitors.  Such pages can benefit businesses with minimal brand recognition and search traffic.Example: Below is an example of Salesmate’s comparison page – Salesmate vs. HubSpotIt shows a clear comparison between the two platforms and provides quick glance into values provided by Salesmate to capture attention immediately. 

A badass alternative to HubSpot!Check out how Salesmate is a better choice compared to HubSpot.Salesmate vs. HubSpot12. Design a dedicated social media strategyHumans are social creatures. And most individuals do follow at least one of the existing platforms, such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, or YouTube.Having an active social media presence can increase your brand’s visibility. And this can be done by implementing a strategy of lead generation in digital marketing. But one must set definite objectives when creating content for the same.You must choose the right tool and methods to implement your content effectively. One of the most effective lead generation strategies in 2023 for increasing awareness among prospects is posting short videos.But social media also has an ever-changing landscape. So, you must timely optimize and measure your campaign’s effectiveness.13. Post relevant content consistentlyOne can rest assured that their content will stay in the top SERP rankings as long as it’s relevant and well-optimized. One of the best strategies for lead generation is content marketing, as high-quality content is always rewarded by search engines.Search engines appreciate websites that offer quick and informative answers to user queries.  Your website will rank organically on search engines. For instance, if you create posts that answer a subject’s who, what, and how queries.In addition to this, you’ll dominate the local market as a benefit of lead gen tactics that show results based on physical location.Example:Here are the non-ad results observed when we search for the ‘best craft beer shops in NYC.’One might get instant results compared to other lead gen strategies mentioned above. But content can surely set you up for the long run.We recommend you invest at least a year or two before expecting results using this tactic.And if you are planning to implement a lead generation software, I would insist you to check out our blog on best lead generation tools and select the right one for you.AfterwordOne can try different lead generation strategies depending on the business industry they serve. If you want more information about lead generation, check out our detailed guide on lead generation.But the trick is to implement strategies based on their results and longevity.We hope our read serves you right in deciding your next lead generation strategy.

Choose your industry and nicheThe foremost step when starting a successful lead generation company is to decide which industry to focus on. The best choice is to go for a booming industry that might not have excess competition.See the image below to find the potential industries that can be your likely client.The smart way to do this is by picking a specific niche.For example, be more specific, like diet chocolates, instead of choosing a chocolate industry.Here are some essential tips that will help you in your market research to decide on your niche:
Find out how much knowledge you have about the market.  Figure out the profit margin and long-term value from the leads. How competitive is the niche? At what level does the market get saturated? Firstly, make a list of industries that you see worth considering for a lead generation business. Do thorough market research based on the above questions. This practice will help you in generating leads faster.Based on your analysis, try to pick the one with good demand, has the least competition, can give a high commission, and isn’t saturated yet.  Note: Narrow down your domain for effective targeting. Follow the pattern of narrowing down mentioned below.  Marketing software > email marketing software > email marketing software for eCommerce companies.2. Develop lead generation assetsThe most crucial step for a lead generation business is to develop the necessary assets, as your business is highly dependent on them.Lead generation assets include web content that can help attract the most relevant audience for a particular industry, niche, etc. For example, healthcare brands share patient and expert testimonials to get the right HCP engagement for their business.Make sure your lead generation assets are up to the mark with the following factors: 
Relevancy: Your audience will show interest in your content if they find it useful.Depth: Your content must be able to provide specific insights. Original value: Your audience looks for content that is unique and interesting to their mind. Remember, unique content builds more prominent brands!Intrigue power: Your content must spark curiosity that leads to more engagement.Actionability: Your content must be able to trigger your audience to act.

Close clients along with lead generationThe process of lead generation and pitching clients should go hand in hand. It must go in a flow; once leads are generated, you must have the client make a sale. Those new in this business make the mistake of pitching clients after they generate the leads. It’s better to do both processes simultaneously; lead generation with the assets and client pitching. Presumably, I believe you are new to this game. So let me tell you, every lead generation business must have a backend where it collects leads generated from its assets.A backend is a client-facing interface where they can see freshly generated leads.  Your clients can filter data, find contact information, and make reports using this backend.Let’s learn with an example.Suppose you have a blog ranking for pet care services. It’s ranking well on Google and gets thousands of visits every month. You have attached a lead capture form as a lead magnet on this blog, where you collect lead information. So, once the visitors start filling out the form, you require a backend to collect this data in an organized manner.There are two ways to collect the data: Route it to a spreadsheetThis is a general and unorganized way to gather leads in a spreadsheet. You can rely on spreadsheets at the start of your business, but not for too long.It gets uncomfortable and messy.Develop a lead database If you have a proper lead generation database, you can sort leads. Also, filter them out to identify the sales funnel they belong to. This is where the Salesmate ecosystem can help you. Using Salesmate Web Forms, you can automatically collect lead data into CRM.You can easily filter and sort the leads using 70+ filters in Salesmate. You can also create custom fields in Salesmate to identify leads in a better way.In Salesmate, you can use Live Chat, Chat Journeys, or Meeting Scheduler to collect leads with Web Forms. With Salesmate, you can enrich your prospects’ profiles and set up lead generation campaigns to nurture them to get a more qualified lead for your client.4. Reach out to your potential clientsUnlike any other business, you need potential clients to monetize your lead generation business in real terms.As I mentioned, you should start approaching clients with lead generation efforts.  Here, your communication and networking skills will play a vital role.Here are some of the most promising ways to get your potential clients –1. Trace your competitors’ lead generation efforts to beat them.2. Build a list of clients along with key information such as the website, contact info of managers/reps, company’s email, and address. 3. Research your client thoroughly. For example, their new branch, potential products matching your leads list, marketing channels, their struggles with lead generation, etc. 4. Reach out to your potential clients with your best cold pitch through emails, LinkedIn, Twitter, or any other active platform. 5. Create a sorted commission structureYour lead generation business will become more lucrative if you can nail down the margin between the lead acquisition cost and your selling price. To discover the profit margins for building a moneymaking lead generation company, you need to be clear about the following: 
Your target audience and their demands. The type of pricing model that you want to proceed with. Your focused channels to generate leads.  Here are two of the most reliable pricing models you can use for your lead generation business.Model 1: Flat fee retainerIn this model, you send a certain number of leads to your clients monthly at a fixed price. Every business would love to save time in lead nurturing. So, they would be happy to spend money on pre-qualified leads for their business. The price may vary depending on your industry and the quality level of the lead.  When choosing the fee model, remember that it might be harder to set a premium price as you deal with a fixed number of monthly leads. The pressure of meeting the target of generating a fixed number of leads monthly results in degrading lead quality. Hence, if your clients experience a lesser conversion rate, they will no longer prefer using your services. Also, if your client has a small business, their sales team might not be able to handle the fixed number of leads per month. Probably, they can be inconsistent in terms of buying as they would complete the existing stock first. Model 2: Cost Per Lead (CPL)This model can be understood by its name; you will charge per lead to your client.On average, you can charge somewhat from $20 up to $100 per lead; again, the price will depend on the industry and qualification of the lead. CPL is quite lucrative over flat fee mode; hence, most lead generation businesses sell leads based on this model. There are three main reasons for the CPL model’s popularity: 
A better understanding of clients’ needs lets you generate high-quality leads. Clients are ready to pay if a single motive gets achieved, e.g., prospects taking a free trial of your product. Profitable as you can increase your profit margins with happy clients. The cost per lead model gives various opportunities of making money with different variations: 
Cost per meeting Cost per form filling Exclusivity of leads (you can send lead data to one client exclusively.) If you don’t know how to calculate the profit, see below: Profit = Selling price of leads – Lead Acquisition Cost I hope you get a thorough idea about the models of charging money for leads.6. Develop a solid process to filter and distribute leads to clientsThe most challenging and critical work for a lead generation business is to provide the most relevant purpose-meeting leads to their clients. Once you’ve generated a customer list for a client, you have to figure out how likely the lead is ready to convert before you handover it over to your client for their business. An unqualified or non-converting lead will spoil your business reputation as you lose your potential clients. So, how to protect your business from this trouble?You must have a solid lead nurturing process to filter out the most effective leads to delivery. Salesmate software can help nurture your leads to find highly qualified leads. You can send targeted emails to your leads and track their engagement. Plus, you will get free customizable email templates. You can automate the email campaign to stay one step ahead of your competitors. Note: Providing high-conversion leads to clients is an excellent opportunity to increase your profit margins by raising your prices.Those who have started or are planning to start a lead generation process must take a free trial to test their business potential.
