That shows your prospects are booking the demo but not joining on time. You can solve this problem by automating a simple\u00a0email prior to the demo time.\u00a0\nThe total number of no-show demos is high, but the rescheduling of demos is very low. That means your prospects are missing demos in the first place and not booking the demos again. Maybe you can give a phone call and text message with a calendar link when prospects miss their "

But what can you do to change that?\u00a0\u00a0\nThis is where sales performance tracking changes the game. \u00a0\nOur aim for this article is to understand the importance of sales performance tracking and find the right reports\u00a0that will help you predict the success of your team.\u00a0\n4 primary benefits of tracking sales\u00a0\n\n1. Discover problems at an early stage\u00a0\nSales performance tracking keeps you updated on any alterations in the existing process. This helps you to detect problems at an early stage and strategize accordingly.\u00a0\nUltimately, sales tracking is similar to taking a precaution than a cure.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor example, you have a sales funnel dashboard in your CRM, and you notice a significantly lower percentage of leads moving toward the middle of the funnel from the top of the funnel stage.\u00a0\nIn such a scenario, you can take the necessary steps, like focusing more on customer engagement or altering\u00a0the strategy, etc., to ensure that the problem gets solved.\u00a0\u00a0\nThis way, sales performance tracking can help you prevent future blunders by detecting problems at an early stage.\u00a0\nHere are some more examples of predictions you can make based on sales performance tracking:\u00a0\n\nYou have a healthy demo booking, but the demo completion rate is very low. That shows your prospects are booking the demo but not joining on time. You can solve this problem by automating a simple\u00a0email prior to the demo time.\u00a0\nThe total number of no-show demos is high, but the rescheduling of demos is very low. That means your prospects are missing demos in the first place and not booking the demos again. Maybe you can give a phone call and text message with a calendar link when prospects miss their "

This is because customer service is only one part of the overall experience that a customer has.\u00a0Customer experience is made up of the service, resources, products, and promotions a company offers its clientele. When all of these factors are great, it equals a great customer experience. Customer service obviously impacts this, as it can be positive or negative, but if this one thing is negative and all other components of an experience are positive, the overall experience would still be satisfactory.\u00a02. Ryan CartwrightHead of sales,\u00a0Spacelift\u00a0The terms \u201ccustomer service\u201d and \u201ccustomer experience\u201d are often confused or used synonymously. They\u2019re not the same thing, even though they\u2019re related.Customer service focuses on human interaction and customer support, while customer experience encompasses the customer\u2019s whole journey with the business from start to finish. Customer experience includes customer service, the product/service itself, marketing and design, and the feelings the customer has for the company.\u00a0\u00a0To think that customer service is the same as CX is diminishing the entire customer journey it takes to be aware and loyal to the brand.\u00a03. Matt MillerCEO and Founder of\u00a0Embroker\u00a0In a sense, it is true. But there are some important factors you have to consider.\u00a0\u00a0Customer service is only one part of the customer experience! You also have"

Andre\u00a0KazimierskyCEO,\u00a0Improovy\u00a0Whether or not live chat alienates customers depends on how it is executed. If the customer has to go through 10 minutes of communicating with a bot before waiting to chat with a person, they will likely feel alienated. Conversely, if they click a live chat\u00a0box and are immediately connected to customer service, live chat can be a valuable tool for a company.2. Henson TsaiFounder,\u00a0SleekFlow\u00a0I\u00a0Don\u2019t think Live Chat alienates customers.\u00a0Rather, it depends on how your Live Chat route is set and whether you have a system behind it to support smooth and no delayed customer service.

Georgi TodorovFounder, ThriveMyWay\u00a0This myth is by those people who believe that they need to make 100 calls in order to get 5 leads and make 1 sale. That\u2019s lousy thinking.\u00a0\u00a0I used to cold call businesses trying to sell them SEO services back in 2013-2014. I failed tremendously despite the fact I was making 30 calls a day.\u00a0\u00a0A couple of years later I am not even trying to sell but I am getting new leads on a daily basis. And I make 0 calls. My performance is much better. Focus on performance, not on numbers.\u00a03. Nick Shackelford\u00a0Managing Partner, "

Kent Lewis\u00a0President & Founder, Anvil\u00a0Marketing, by definition, includes advertising, public relations, promotions, events, direct response and all things digital (marketing).\u00a0Saying advertising is the same as marketing is like saying PR is the same as marketing. One is a subset of the other. PR, advertising and other marketing disciplines are a subset of marketing. Period. I\u2019m personally annoyed when people in my industry (digital marketing) interchange the term \u201csearch engine marketing\u201d or SEM with \u201cpay-per-click\u201d or PPC. One is a subset of the other. SEM includes advertising and search engine optimization (SEO).\u00a0PPC only includes any form of digital advertising that relies on the payment on a per-click basis (typically text ads on Google and Bing). I wish more marketers were properly schooled, as I was when I graduated with a business degree and marketing concentration.\u00a02. Max Benz\u00a0Founder"

You need to know what your customers need to succeed.\u00a0But how can one sell? Traditionally when we think of sales, an image of a pushy salesperson comes to our head.

In today\u2019s digitally-connected world, every industry is turning more data-driven and requires facts and figures right at their fingertips.Sales pipeline management is the one step you take to get closer to your sales quotas and achieve your revenue goals.Like said before, a sales pipeline gets your goals into a perspective so that you can focus only on the important and leave the rest for later.What is a sales pipeline?A sales pipeline is a visual representation of where a particular lead stands in the sales process. It shows how many deals a salesperson has closed or is about to close in a week, month, or over a quarter, to achieve sales quotas.Maintaining a healthy pipeline allows you to build your approach towards your targets, and bring in as much business as expected of you.Say, for example, your pipeline is worth $100,000, and your conversion rate from lead to sale is 10%, then you can expect to close $10,000 worth of business. However, if your target is $20,000, you\u2019ll either have to line up more prospects or convert twice as many leads to achieve your sales quotas.This is where sales pipeline analysis comes in handy. When you have a clear view of your prospects and conversion rates, you can plan your sales strategies accordingly and get better results sooner.A sales pipeline is an essential sales management tool that helps you increase your sales team\u2019s productivity.

To sell in this modern business world, you need to start focusing on the buyers.\u00a0Unless you are offering something unique, your potential prospects have plenty of product options available in the market. However, most of them would like to deal with a business that would make an effort to understand what they require. They would want someone who would guide and help.\u00a0 This is why needs-based selling is gaining more attention in the modern sales world.\u00a0Get closer to your customers. So close that you tell your customers what they need even before they realize it. \u2013 Steve Jobs\u00a0Needs-based selling-how to do it right\u00a0Sales reps often focus on fulfilling their target instead of giving attention to the prospects, which is why most of them fail. Yes, you need to fulfill the goals, but for that, the potential prospects must purchase your product. Well, persuading prospects to invest their precious dollars can get difficult if you don\u2019t spend time in understanding them.In needs-based selling, the salesperson puts the prospects first and tries to understand what they need by asking relevant questions. Needs-based selling focuses on building lasting relationships that not only help in converting prospects into paying customers but also encourages positive word of mouth.\u00a0Courteous treatment will make a customer a walking advertisement. \u2013 James Cash Penney\u00a01.

They fear that the call will end in rejection, or they might infuriate the prospects by disturbing them.\u00a048% of sales are afraid to make cold calls.Cold calling is an old but one of the most effective ways of reaching new opportunities.\u00a0Even the brain behind Uber, Travis Kalanick, found his first few customers through cold calling.\u00a0Quoting Travis Kalanick (Founder of Uber) \u2013\u00a0\u201cI went to Google, typed in San Francisco chauffeur or San Francisco limousine, I just filled out an excel sheet, and I just started dialing for dollars, right? The first ten guys I called, three of them hung up before I got a few words out, a few of them would listen for like 45 seconds and then hung up, and three of them said, \u2018I\u2019m interested, let\u2019s meet.\u2019.

However, if you want to reach the end destination, i.e., success, then you need to overcome the challenges that come your way.\u00a0Fear limits us; it causes anxiety, restlessness, and powerlessness. With a fearful mind, you cannot think clearly and have a meaningful conversation with the prospect.Prospecting is an essential phase of the sales process.

Something that the prospect is completely unaware of.Secondly, the sales rep tailors his sales process for the prospect. Everything from the sales pitch to negotiation. He makes sure the discussion is about the larger problem.Lastly, the rep takes charge of the entire conversation and offers his solution to the prospect at the right point.Brent Adamson, an author and VP of Gartner, states that the most preferred sales rep persona is \u201cRelationship Builder\u201d.This is obvious because this persona helps sales reps in building deeper bonds with prospects and customers.

There are certain rules that you should be following for creating a win-win situation.Here are a few rules that you need to follow:1. Be ready to walk awayWhat happens when you try to open a pickle jar and are not able to do it. You try harder, put in efforts and then just ask someone else to do it to save your time.

You could have used this time on something more productive.It is necessary to gain a sense of control during negotiation. Often sellers feel that buyers have control and they can get things done their way. This isn\u2019t necessary; it is the seller who gives the power to the buyers by placing themselves in a weaker position.You only lose control when you don\u2019t take control \u2013 Kylie FrancisGain control and walk away if the terms of the deals are not as pe"

Charge moreEntrepreneur overthink when it comes to increasing the price of their product. Yes, it is a matter of concern because customers avoid purchasing a product with a high price tag.But if handled smartly, this strategy can generate revenues in a great amount. Here, your ability to demonstrate the value of your product is tested. If you succeed, then it can maximize your profit margins.You can start by taking small steps. For example, a study found that raising the price by 1% can increase profits by 11%. However, before raising the prices, ensure you explain the reason for charging more to your existing customers.Make sure your product is good enough for that price range, as customers don\u2019t mind paying more if they can benefit from it.2. Use the power of social mediaSocial media channels are the most effective low budget methods to boost sales of your small business. More than 50 million small businesses currently use Facebook pages to connect with their customers.Join industry-related groups on Facebook and LinkedIn to expand your networks and win new clients.91% of prospective B2B buyers are now active and involved in social media, creating an ample opportunity for your salespeople to have successful sales by engaging with them.Keep sharing useful insights and offers about your products"

Words, tone of voice, and emotions are all important aspects of developing rapport, and no email, text, or InMail can convey those things properly.The key to cold calling is to warm the calls up quickly. There are some easy ways to do that, just take a look at the simple strategies below. First though, let\u2019s discuss whether you should have a calling script or not.To Script, Or Not to ScriptThere is a debate among salespeople about whether using a script for sales calls is a good idea. Those who are in favor of using scripts believe that it helps keep you on track, prevents gaps in the conversation, and makes sure that you hit all the important points. Those opposed to using scripts argue that it makes the call sound unnatural and robotic and that it doesn\u2019t allow genuineness and personality to shine.Both sides make valid arguments. That\u2019s why it is important to have the right information at your fingertips, but it\u2019s also important to sound like a real person. If you choose to use scripts for your cold calling, be sure that you are comfortable enough with the information that you are able to go \u2019\u2019off book\u2019\u2019 and use real, unscripted responses for a good portion of the call.

            "content": "Making sales calls is the number one duty listed on every sales position job description. Whether it\u2019s cold calling or talking to warm leads, it\u2019s something that sales reps must master in order to be successful. Like any other operational procedure, making sales calls has to have a plan that reps can follow and learn from.Having a pre-call plan is crucial to making successful sales calls. The following are six easy steps to help you make the most of your pre-call planning.1. Research your prospectThis may seem like a rather obvious step, but you might be surprised at how many reps neglect to do it. They go into a call completely, or almost, blind. Taking the time to research both the prospect and the company is time well spent.The purpose of this step is twofold. First, it allows you to build rapport with the prospect. When you know a few things about them \u2019 which you can easily find on social media sites \u2019 you have instant conversation starters. Second, and most importantly, it provides you with valuable information about the company, the industry, and what issues they are having that your product can help with.2. Know the prospect\u2019s competitorsOnce you\u2019ve learned about the prospect and the company, you should also learn about their competitors. By gathering information about what their competitors are doing \u2019 the good and the bad \u2019 you will be able to customize your selling strategy when offering solutions. Knowing what\u2019s happening with competitors shows your prospect that you have done your homework and you understand their business, and that provides them with comfort.3. Know your objective for the callYou not only have to know and understand the \u2019\u2019who\u2019\u2019 of the sales call you\u2019re going to make but also the \u2019\u2019why.\u2019\u2019 Defining your objective before making the call helps you stay on track. Make sure you are putting all your notes in your sales goal software. How do you do that? You look at where you are in the sales cycle, and what the next stage is. According to Sal"

Does your method include building rapport with your prospects? Paying attention to their specific needs? Listening to their concerns and offering solutions without making a full-blown, script-following sales pitch? If you\u2019re not doing those things already, or if you want to improve what you\u2019re doing, read on for some simple steps to make your consultative selling more effective.What is Consultative Selling?Consultative selling is a way of selling that puts the customer\u2019s needs first. Their needs are discovered by the salesperson through research and preparation, and really focusing and drilling down into customers\u2019 answers. Consultative selling is not the hard-pressing, aggressive sales pitch of days gone by. Instead, those attributes are replaced by rapport, knowledge, flexibility, and meeting customers where they are so they receive a product that is tailor-fit to their business.This approach focuses on salespeople asking the right questions to engage customers in a dialogue so their needs are identified. It requires salespeople to request a lot of feedback and to really hear what the customer is saying. Communication is a key point in the consultative sales methodology, and it can make a huge difference in meeting your sales goals.Steps to Optimize Your Consultative SellingThe following are steps to get you started with consultative selling.Get to Know Your CustomerBefore you meet with your prospective customer, you need to do your homework. Finding out as much as you can about the person you will be meeting with, as well as the company. Social media, Yelp reviews, LinkedIn, and the company website are some good places to start. The more research you do, the more knowledge you will have, and the more likely you will be able to count on a closed deal at the end of the process.It\u2019s also important to understand the compan"

            "content": "It\u2019s a given that the faster you respond to leads, the better chance you have of reaching a closed deal \u2019 research supports this fact. However, research done by InsideSales.com also supports the fact that just over two-thirds of leads never receive a response at all. Just how many sales opportunities are being missed? There isn\u2019t any research to show that number, but it\u2019s likely that the number is significant.The solution to this problem is to define your team\u2019s standard and process of responsiveness, and then using metrics to measure and adjust your process as needed.The following are four steps that will increase your responsiveness and convert more sales:Make Responsiveness a Sales PriorityThe key here is that your sales team understands that responsiveness is a top priority. When a lead comes in, the potential customer expects a timely response. If they don\u2019t get one, they are likely to turn to one of your competitors instead. So it is important that they hear from you as quickly as possible. Automated responses don\u2019t count in this instance \u2019 prospects need to have a prompt, personalized response for your team to be effective.Set Your Team\u2019s StandardsJust like other parts of the sales process, there must be standards for appropriate response timing. Although 24 hours seems to be widely accepted, that is really too long. When you wait that long, many customers will have moved onto other avenues. Whether you decide that 30 minutes or two hours is appropriate for your team, consistency in maintaining the response time is crucial. It also allows for accountability which will help increase your company\u2019s reputation favorably among your potential customers.Measure Your SuccessIn order to know if the standard you have set is being met, you have to be able to measure your team\u2019s success. Your customer relationship management (CRM) software should allow you to create this type of metric so that you can accurately track how quickly your salespeople are responding to leads"

And hopefully, that\u2019s a huge part of your sales team\u2019s expertise. However, your marketing team works hard to get prospects to come to you. Inbound leads can be every bit as valuable as leads that have to be tracked down, but for some reason there tend to be more mistakes made with inbound lead management than outbound sales. Let\u2019s take a look at some common mistakes and how to fix them.Not Delegating Inbound Lead Management to a Specific Person or TeamIt\u2019s not uncommon for inbound leads to be up for grabs. There\u2019s a dashboard for inbound leads, and they are everyone\u2019s responsibility \u2019 which means they are no one\u2019s responsibility. They could sit there for who knows how long because there isn\u2019t a person or team responsible for them. Whether inbound leads are assigned to the marketing department or sales doesn\u2019t really matter, as long as someone is taking a look at them and determining if they are viable leads.The Fix: There must be a process for dealing with inbound leads that assigns responsibility to a person or group, so they are not left to die in the dashboard.Assuming That Every Prospect Action Equals a LeadOne click does not a lead make. Or as Mike Wolfe at Smart Bug Media puts it, \u2019\u2019One simple action taken by a prospect, like clicking an email or downloading a tip sheet, doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that they\u2019re ready to buy your product or speak with someone in sales about it. Handing those kind of \u2019\u2019leads\u2019\u2019 over to a sales rep won\u2019t be very conducive to success for the sales team that is expected to convert those leads into sales.\u2019\u2019The Fix: Before sending the potential lead to the sales department, nurture the relationship to identify who they are, what their buying process is, and if they are truly ready to talk with the sales team. Only then should they be moved on to a sales team member.Not Doing Enough ResearchOnce the lead has"

            "content": "Imagine a sales world where every customer came to you already interested and ready to buy your product. Your sales would go through the roof! Wouldn\u2019t that be great? Unfortunately, that isn\u2019t how it happens. You have to reach out to potential customers to meet your sales goals. Some leads are more interested than others, some are more ready to buy, and some will take longer to nurture and make a decision. All these types of leads make up your sales pipeline, and it is crucial that you know how to deal with each one.What is a Sales Pipeline?First, let\u2019s take a look at what exactly a sale pipeline is. In his article, 5 Best Practices for Managing Your Pipeline, Sales Hacker\u2019s Matt Smith defines it this way, \u2019\u2019The sales pipeline/funnel is a visual representation of all your team\u2019s open opportunities.\u2019\u2019In other words, your sales pipeline is a tool that tells you exactly where each customer or managing the leads is in the sales process. This simple concept can be complicated in practice because there are many sales steps involved, each lead has different business needs, and the timelines and buying readiness are different for each prospect.It\u2019s likely that your organization is already using some type of sales pipeline for managing leads through the sales process \u2019 contact, opportunity, and ideally, on to a sale. The stages that you define for this process are important. Having too many stages wastes valuable time; having too few stages is too rushed and can make sales reps seem pushy (which is off-putting to most people).You have to decide how many stages, and which ones, are right for your company. But based on best practices, 5 or 6 stages works successfully, and they usually include:\nInitial Contact \u2019 This can be a cold call from a leads list, a phone call or website inquiry from a potential customer, or a referral.\nQualification \u2019 This stage is used to find out if your product or service is right for the lead, and vice-versa.\nMeeting \u2019 In this stage, the rep present"

However, there is more involved in sustaining an exceptional sales career. What exactly is it that champion sales performers have that others don\u2019t? They share some key attributes, and we\u2019ve made a list of them for you.Qualities of Elite Sales Performers\nResponsible \u2019 Salespeople who reach the highest ranks take ownership of the thigs that matter \u2019 their product, the process, and their performance. They accept responsibility for all three, never crediting or blaming anyone for their own victories or failures. Because they take responsibility for these things, they set high standards for themselves and often go far beyond those set by their company.\nTrainable \u2019 Not everyone is a born salesperson. Top sellers often become elite performers not because they have an inherent trait for selling, but rather because they embrace continued learning that consistently ups their game. They seek new and creative ways to overcome challenges and are willing to learn new things that augment their selling techniques.\nKnowledgeable \u2019 Top performers learn as much as they can about the products they are selling, not just the standard features and benefits that all reps are expected to know. They know the products inside and out allowing them to express pride and confidence when talking with potential customers. Top salespeople take it upon themselves to know \u2019 really know \u2019 what it is they are offering customers. And they never feel like they are finished learning. According to an article by Entrepreneur\u2019s writer, Toby Nwazor, \u2019\u2019To be a sales superstar, you need to learn every day.

But have you taken the time to define your sales cycle for your team? Many business owners assume that their sales team already knows. However, taking the time to create a detailed definition of the sales cycle that is specific to your company and relaying it to all team members is an endeavor that is worth the effort \u2019 it will benefit both your customers and your team\u2019s sales goals.What is a Sales Cycle?First, the definition of a sales cycle. Putting it in the most basic of terms, the sales cycle is the process of steps taken to close a sale. The sales cycle encompasses all the steps and activities that your salespeople perform taking a customer from a lead to a completed deal. After the closed sale, the final step is to ask the customer for referrals and then the cycle begins again with new leads.Reasons You Need to Define the Sales CycleHaving a defined sales cycle for your company is beneficial for numerous reasons including:\nIt allows you to predict your revenue. Because a well-defined sales process is repeatable and predictable, you are able to forecast more accurately.\nIt allows you to identify areas for improvement. When your sales cycle is defined and followed, you can see what is working and what isn\u2019t, allowing you to make adjustments as needed.\nIt allows you to integrate new sales team members quickly. Providing new staff with a clear definition of the sales process will allow them to acclimate faster.\nIt gives you a process to manage and analyze. With a distinct system in place that is followed by all sales staff, you instantly have a process that is easier to monitor and measure.Setting Your Pipeline StagesThe first step in creating a clearly defined sales cycle is identifying the stages of the sales process for your company.

But you already know that because setting sales goals is addressed in just about every type of sales training there is \u2019 seminars, online courses, sales books, and even your weekly or monthly sales meetings. So, there\u2019s no reason to get into the why of it, we need to look at the how. How do you set the right sales goals for your team and your company?There is a right way and a wrong way to set sales goals. When you do it right, you are able to better manage your sales pipeline while increasing sales at the same time.Setting the right type of sales goals isn\u2019t easy. Many sales leaders set un-achievable results-oriented goals that no one can possibly meet. All that does is lower morale, which in turn lowers productivity. Why? Because we can\u2019t control results. But what we can do is control our own actions. That\u2019s why setting activity goals is the key to reaching remarkable sales results.What Are Activity Goals?Activity goals involve just that \u2019 activities. For example, rather than setting a goal of selling $1,000 of products each day, try setting a goal of reaching and talking to 25 prospects each day. That is an attainable goal, over which you have control. You can\u2019t control what each prospect decides to buy or not to buy, but you can control how many prospects you talk to. And in doing that, you will see your sales dollars climb, rather than seeing your morale fall.Taking the focus off results and putting it on activities improves confidence and makes you more effective and productive in achieving your goals. Gareth Goh says it this way in his article on InsightSquared.com, \u2019\u2019Regardless of what happens on the output, each rep should have no trouble hitting these input-based goals of hitting a certain number of calls each day, week, month and quarter.\u2019\u2019 The results will come by focusing on what you can do, not what you have no control over.Getting into the Habit of Setting the Best Sales GoalsTo get to "

It\u2019s one of the bases of modern marketing.\u00a0\nWhether you try email marketing, offer gated content, or wish to check conversions with web forms, data is the basis of all activities.\u00a0\nNot having a dedicated database to manage your leads can make you lose track of where they stand in your sales funnel.\u00a0\u00a0\nPlus, it\u2019s a big blow to your marketing analysis and strategy creation.\u00a0\u00a0\nIntroducing a powerful tool like CRM can be a solution for effective\u00a0contact management\u00a0and streamlining business communications.\u00a0\n3. Reaching out to the right audience\u00a0\nHaving a clear idea of your buyer persona and buyer\u2019s journey can help you find important channels where your target audience is present.\u00a0\nMost manufacturing firms are unaware of what a buyer persona can do and how it can help them choose their dream marketing channel.\u00a0\nThe first job is to create a buyer persona.\u00a0\nMind you, creating a persona is a bit complex, and it includes a rooted thought process.\u00a0\u00a0\nA buyer persona answers two questions:\u00a0\n\nWho is our best historical customer?\u00a0\nDo we still want to sell to them?\u00a0\n\nTools like CRM or Google Analytics will give you detailed insights into the demography, age, gender, and interests of your current leads and past customers.\u00a0\nNext, you must experiment with all the channels using the buyer persona and find the perfect one for your business.\u00a0\nWhen these two things are clear, you will easily solve the problem of reaching out to the right audience.\u00a0\n4. Not able to choose the right social media strategy\u00a0\nMost manufacturer businesses refrain from social media as they lack the adequate knowledge to implement accurate strategies.\nBut it\u2019s not as complicated as you think.\u00a0\nAlso, manufacturers have succumbed to myths like:\u00a0\n\ntheir targeted prospects don\u2019t access social media\ntheir products aren\u2019t visually appealing for these social platforms\nmanufacturers don\u2019t find social platforms to be a viable solution for selling their products\u00a0\n\nHaving a presence on these social channels is important as it offers benefits such as:\u00a0\n\nincreased brand awareness and reach (more on this in the next section)\u00a0\npromoting your brand as a thought leader\u00a0\ninstill trust in your prospect\u2019s mind by humanizing your brand\u00a0\n\nHere\u2019s a great\u00a0resource\u00a0on how manufacturers can leverage social platforms to grow their brands like a pro!\u00a0\n5.

            "content": "Key Takeaways22% of sales reps reported qualification for sales as the most arduous task.The ANUM sales framework lets you easily qualify based on authority, need, urgency, and money.You can set your qualification process on automation with a chatbot.\nAccording to a study, 22% of sales reps reported sales qualification as the most challenging part of their sales process.\u00a0\u00a0\nMaybe those still need to introduce a sales lead qualification framework!\u00a0\u00a0\nVarious sales methodologies can help you qualify the actual buyers. And today, we are discussing one of the most effective sales frameworks- ANUM.\nMoreover, you can set your qualification process on autopilot.\nSo, let\u2019s find all the nitty-gritty of the ANUM framework.\nWhat is the ANUM sales qualification framework?\u00a0\nKen Krogue develops the ANUM framework. It is a lead qualification framework that takes a customer-centric approach and helps sales reps identify sales opportunities.\u00a0\u00a0\nIt is a restructured version of the\u00a0BANT\u00a0framework where authority is prioritized over budget.\u00a0\u00a0\nProspecting isn\u2019t easy. Reps invest a lot of effort and time in contacting the right audience.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn such a scenario, realizing that you reached out to an irrelevant prospect is devastating.\u00a0\nANUM is a practical framework as it qualifies based on whether they have decision-making powers or not.\nAlso, beginning your sales pitch focusing on a budget can be daunting. Here\u2019s why the ANUM framework seems effective, as it considers money criteria later.\nMoreover, this framework helps\u00a0reps save time and effort by deciding whether they are dealing with the right prospects or need to look for the correct ones.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nLet\u2019s understand each qualification criterion of ANUM.\nThe complete process of the ANUM qualification\u00a0framework\n\n1. Authority\u00a0\u00a0\nYou just can\u2019t afford to work on a lead that has no power to make the purchasing decision.\nThis is why the ANUM framework prioritizes authority. It lets you discover whether you are pitching your winning script to the decision-maker or not.\u00a0\nBut who is/are the potential decision-makers?\u00a0\u00a0\nWell- it depends.\u00a0\u00a0\nThere is no perfect definition of the decision-maker. It is purely subjective to the company and its organizational structure.\nAt some companies, it may be a CFO or a departmental head; in some processes, there may be a group of people who need to be involved throughout the process, and so on.\nThe technique is to ask the right qualifying question to the MQLs to discover whether they have the decision-making authority or not.\nTo understand the authority of a prospect to make the purchase decision, you should ask the questions mentioned below:\n\nCan you help me know your company\u2019s buying process, especially with purchasing a product or service like ours?\u00a0\nIs there anyone else from your team that needs to be included in this conversation?\u00a0\nHow are purchasing decisions typically made in your organization for products/services like ours?\nWho is responsible for making the final purchase decision?\u00a0\nCan you include the (decision maker) in our call?\u00a0\nCan you help me with the coordinates of (the decision maker) to contact them directly?\u00a0\n\nWhat if you discover that the lead you\u2019re communicating with for sales isn\u2019t the decision-maker?\u00a0\nWell, you shouldn\u2019t cut off the lead who isn\u2019t the decision-maker, as they can serve as a bridge to reach the person concerned.\u00a0\u00a0\n2. Need\u00a0\u00a0\nOnce you\u2019ve tapped the decision-maker, you must understand their requirements and expectations from a brand like yours.\u00a0\u00a0\nUnderstanding their pain points and taking the conversation in the right direction is vital.\nAt this stage, you should be aware of their role and responsibilities. This helps you to offer a tailored solution to them.\u00a0\nIdentifying customers\u2019 needs would help you offer a consultive sales approach that boosts the probability of deal conversion.\u00a0\nNearly 53% of sales representatives believe the consultative selling approach makes their sales process more efficient.\u00a0\nAs this method considers having a consultation session with the potential buyer that caters to their requirement.\nBelow are the questions you can ask the lead to understand their needs:\u00a0\n\nWhat\u2019s the key problem your company/ team/ department faces?\u00a0\nWhat\u2019s the source of this key problem?\u00a0\nWhat\u2019s the goal your team/company aims at achieving?\u00a0\nWhy hasn\u2019t it been addressed before?\u00a0\nWhat would be the ideal solution for this problem?\u00a0\u00a0\n\n3. Urgency\u00a0\nAt this stage, you must determine the importance and extremity of your prospect\u2019s purchase plan.\nThis phase is even denoted as priority and timing in some other frameworks like (BANT, FAINT, CHAMP, etc.)\u00a0\u00a0\nThis stage evaluates how urgently your prospect requires the solution to their problem.\u00a0\u00a0\nHowever, there is an urgency in an ideal situation at this stage since you already know the prospects are facing problems and need a solution.\nSo, here\u2019s how you can even directly discover these factors by asking a question like:\n\nWhat\u2019s the timeframe for getting the problem fixed?\u00a0\nHow long can you "

I believe modern consulting businesses should have a strong marketing engine to build a solid sales pipeline.\u00a0\u00a0\nSo, let\u2019s dive right in.\u00a0\nHow to build a strong sales pipeline for your consulting business?\u00a0\nBuilding your ideal sales pipeline consists of 4 key steps:\n\nKeep the marketing lead generation engine running\u00a0\nQualify leads for MQL\u00a0\nQualification by the sales team\u00a0\nCreate a meaningful sales\u00a0pipeline\u00a0\n\nStep 1: Keep the marketing lead generation engine running\u00a0\nEvery successful sales conversion begins with collecting the leads, qualifying them for marketing, and submitting them to the salespeople.\u00a0\u00a0\nTo get things in motion, marketers must take care of the basics:\u00a0\n\nIdentify your target audience\u00a0\nDefine the kind of content they would appreciate\u00a0\nPlan a content execution strategy\u00a0\nDistribute content meaningfully\u00a0\nCollect leads through forms and newsletter signups\u00a0\n\n1.

Distribute your published content\u00a0\nNow that you\u2019ve created your cluster topics and suitable content around them, you must tell the world.\u00a0\u00a0\nMore specifically, it would help to let your desired audience know that you\u2019ve published content and what it\u2019s about.\u00a0\u00a0\nThere are several ways to tell your audience about your published content.\u00a0\nPost on social media and groups: Create posts about the problems and solutions your audience seeks.\nPost them on social media platforms like Facebook, LinkedIn, and community groups to help increase your brand identity.\nAssociating links with social media posts can give you more traffic as well.\u00a0\nEmail marketing: Send a glimpse of new content to your subscribers.

These are common challenges you need to fix to generate potential leads.\n1. Transitioning to new marketing and lead generation techniques\u00a0\nManufacturers face a unique business challenge upon switching to the current technological landscape.\nThe older generation has followed traditional marketing techniques and may have gotten great results.\u00a0\u00a0\nMany times, sales heads take care of marketing at manufacturing firms.\u00a0\nAt the same time, a new generation is entering the field with a digital-first approach.\u00a0\nThe conflict happens when these two generations have to work together in harmony.\u00a0\nOften manufacturing companies fail to find common ground between these two generations of mindset people.\u00a0\nThe best way to solve this conflict is to \u2013 sit together and find the pros and cons of what can work in marketing TODAY!\u00a0\nYou can ask the following questions to the team and lead the discussion:\u00a0\n\nWhat are the best marketing campaigns we have had?\u00a0\nWhy did our marketing campaigns work in the past?\u00a0\nIs customer psychology still the same as 10 years ago?\u00a0\nCan we learn from past experience and implement the lessons on new digital techniques?\u00a0\n\nSo, clarity among the team regarding why we are taking this approach will ease the process of lead generation for manufacturers.\u00a0\n2. The manufacturing companies still don\u2019t take marketing data seriously\u00a0\nData is the currency to make sound business decisions. It\u2019s one of the bases of modern marketing.\u00a0\nWhether you try email marketing, offer gated content, or wish to check conversions with web forms, data is the basis of all activities.\u00a0\nNot having a dedicated database to manage your leads can make you lose track of where they stand in your sales funnel.\u00a0\u00a0\nPlus, it\u2019s a big blow to your marketing analysis and strategy creation.\u00a0\u00a0\nIntroducing a powerful tool like CRM can be a solution for effective\u00a0contact management\u00a0and streamlining business communications.\u00a0\n3. Reaching out to the right audience\u00a0\nHaving a clear idea of your buyer persona and buyer\u2019s journey can help you find important channels where your target audience is present.\u00a0\nMost manufacturing firms are unaware of what a buyer persona can do and how it can help them choose their dream marketing channel.\u00a0\nThe first job is to create a buyer persona.\u00a0\nMind you, creating a persona is a bit complex, and it includes a rooted thought process.\u00a0\u00a0\nA buyer persona answers two questions:\u00a0\n\nWho is our best historical customer?\u00a0\nDo we still want to sell to them?\u00a0\n\nTools like CRM or Google Analytics will give you detailed insights into the demography, age, gender, and interests of your current leads and past customers.\u00a0\nNext, you must experiment with all the channels using the buyer persona and find the perfect one for your business.\u00a0\nWhen these two things are clear, you will easily solve the problem of reaching out to the right audience.\u00a0\n4. Not able to choose the right social media strategy\u00a0\nMost manufacturer businesses refrain from social media as they lack the adequate knowledge to implement accurate strategies.\nBut it\u2019s not as complicated as you think.\u00a0\nAlso, manufacturers have succumbed to myths like:\u00a0\n\ntheir targeted prospects don\u2019t access social media\ntheir products aren\u2019t visually appealing for these social platforms\nmanufacturers don\u2019t find social platforms to be a viable solution for selling their products\u00a0\n\nHaving a presence on these social channels is important as it offers benefits such as:\u00a0\n\nincreased brand awareness and reach (more on this in the next section)\u00a0\npromoting your brand as a thought leader\u00a0\ninstill trust in your prospect\u2019s mind by humanizing your brand\u00a0\n\nHere\u2019s a great\u00a0resource\u00a0on how manufacturers can leverage social platforms to grow their brands like a pro!\u00a0\n5.

And today, we are discussing one of the most effective sales frameworks- ANUM.\nMoreover, you can set your qualification process on autopilot.\nSo, let\u2019s find all the nitty-gritty of the ANUM framework.\nWhat is the ANUM sales qualification framework?\u00a0\nKen Krogue develops the ANUM framework. It is a lead qualification framework that takes a customer-centric approach and helps sales reps identify sales opportunities.\u00a0\u00a0\nIt is a restructured version of the\u00a0BANT\u00a0framework where authority is prioritized over budget.\u00a0\u00a0\nProspecting isn\u2019t easy. Reps invest a lot of effort and time in contacting the right audience.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn such a scenario, realizing that you reached out to an irrelevant prospect is devastating.\u00a0\nANUM is a practical framework as it qualifies based on whether they have decision-making powers or not.\nAlso, beginning your sales pitch focusing on a budget can be daunting. Here\u2019s why the ANUM framework seems effective, as it considers money criteria later.\nMoreover, this framework helps\u00a0reps save time and effort by deciding whether they are dealing with the right prospects or need to look for the correct ones.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nLet\u2019s understand each qualification criterion of ANUM.\nThe complete process of the ANUM qualification\u00a0framework\n\n1. Authority\u00a0\u00a0\nYou just can\u2019t afford to work on a lead that has no power to make the purchasing decision.\nThis is why the ANUM framework prioritizes authority. It lets you discover whether you are pitching your winning script to the decision-maker or not.\u00a0\nBut who is/are the potential decision-makers?\u00a0\u00a0\nWell- it depends.\u00a0\u00a0\nThere is no perfect definition of the decision-maker. It is purely subjective to the company and its organizational structure.\nAt some companies, it may be a CFO or a departmental head; in some processes, there may be a group of people who need to be involved throughout the process, and so on.\nThe technique is to ask the right qualifying question to the MQLs to discover whether they have the decision-making authority or not.\nTo understand the authority of a prospect to make the purchase decision, you should ask the questions mentioned below:\n\nCan you help me know your company\u2019s buying process, especially with purchasing a product or service like ours?\u00a0\nIs there anyone else from your team that needs to be included in this conversation?\u00a0\nHow are purchasing decisions typically made in your organization for products/services like ours?\nWho is responsible for making the final purchase decision?\u00a0\nCan you include the (decision maker) in our call?\u00a0\nCan you help me with the coordinates of (the decision maker) to contact them directly?\u00a0\n\nWhat if you discover that the lead you\u2019re communicating with for sales isn\u2019t the decision-maker?\u00a0\nWell, you shouldn\u2019t cut off the lead who isn\u2019t the decision-maker, as they can serve as a bridge to reach the person concerned.\u00a0\u00a0\n2. Need\u00a0\u00a0\nOnce you\u2019ve tapped the decision-maker, you must understand their requirements and expectations from a brand like yours.\u00a0\u00a0\nUnderstanding their pain points and taking the conversation in the right direction is vital.\nAt this stage, you should be aware of their role and responsibilities. This helps you to offer a tailored solution to them.\u00a0\nIdentifying customers\u2019 needs would help you offer a consultive sales approach that boosts the probability of deal conversion.\u00a0\nNearly 53% of sales representatives believe the consultative selling approach makes their sales process more efficient.\u00a0\nAs this method considers having a consultation session with the potential buyer that caters to their requirement.\nBelow are the questions you can ask the lead to understand their needs:\u00a0\n\nWhat\u2019s the key problem your company/ team/ department faces?\u00a0\nWhat\u2019s the source of this key problem?\u00a0\nWhat\u2019s the goal your team/company aims at achieving?\u00a0\nWhy hasn\u2019t it been addressed before?\u00a0\nWhat would be the ideal solution for this problem?\u00a0\u00a0\n\n3. Urgency\u00a0\nAt this stage, you must determine the importance and extremity of your prospect\u2019s purchase plan.\nThis phase is even denoted as priority and timing in some other frameworks like (BANT, FAINT, CHAMP, etc.)\u00a0\u00a0\nThis stage evaluates how urgently your prospect requires the solution to their problem.\u00a0\u00a0\nHowever, there is an urgency in an ideal situation at this stage since you already know the prospects are facing problems and need a solution.\nSo, here\u2019s how you can even directly discover these factors by asking a question like:\n\nWhat\u2019s the timeframe for getting the problem fixed?\u00a0\nHow long can you "

Subject line for an apology email\u00a0\nThe subject line needs to be snappy, clear, and concise.\u00a0\u00a0\nTo help you with this, here are some apology email subject line samples:\n\nHey <customer name>! Please accept our apologies.\u00a0\nAn apology from <your name/business name>.\u00a0\nHi, <customer name>! We made a mistake.\u00a0\nGet confused with our last message?\u00a0\nI am sincerely apologizing.\u00a0\n\nYou must personalize your subject line with the customer\u2019s name to build a better impact.\n2. Humble greeting\u00a0\u00a0\nUse the simple format: Dear <Customer name>\u00a0\nIf you are sending an apology, you probably know your customer\u2019s name or other details. If not, use professional terms like \u201cDear Client\u201d and \u201cDear Customer\u201d for an individual.\nUse \u201cDear All\u201d and \u201cDear Team\u201d\u00a0to address a mass audience.\u00a0\nOr you can write\u00a0\u201cDear\u201d and begin with your opening line.\u00a0\n3. The body of the email\u00a0\nBe empathetic, acknowledge well and offer restitution if necessary.\u00a0\nIn\u00a0Psychology Today, Jeffrey Bernstein, PhD, stated that\u00a0there are three parts to a meaningful, heartfelt apology.\nElements of a great apology:\u00a0\n\nAcknowledge the mistake: You must admit your mistake, as this gesture will positively impact your customers.\u00a0\nBe empathetic: You must express a sense of emotions that you understand the problems faced by your customers due to the mistake that happened. It connects your readers with you naturally.\u00a0\nRestitution: Offer compensation at the end of your email to make them feel important. It helps to regain your customers\u2019 trust and build a stronger relationship.\u00a0\n\n4. Apology email closing\u00a0\u00a0\nThis section is where you must talk about restitution and anything that can contribute to correcting your mistake.\u00a0\nEnsure your closing line is potent to create a good scene and helps you to retrieve your customer relationship.\u00a0\nSee the example below to learn how to end an apology email effectively.\n\nIn the above example, the brand has apologized for sending an older email with an expired coupon CODE. \u00a0\nHowever, they\u2019ve beautifully corrected their mistake and extended the coupon CODE expiry for one more day.\u00a0\n5. Professional email signature\u00a0\nSignatures are integral to any email as it discloses the person to contact if the same mistake happens shortly.\nPlus, it helps to humanize your email in case of mass outreach.\u00a0\nSo, it is better to send an apology letter/email from a known representative, like their relationship manager, marketing"

So, here\u2019s all about FAINT questions and process:\n\u00a0F- Funds\u00a0\u00a0\nThe initial criteria to qualify leads using a FAINT is to check their funding capability. In this framework, you consider their funds\u2019 availability over budget.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe difference between these terms is that your prospect may not have a budget allocated to this solution, but they might have the financial capability to make the purchase.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nYou can find out about their funds by referring to their most recent financial statements and published information.\u00a0\nAlso, you can check any relevant financial magazine to get information about their latest sales figures or revenue generated.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nYou can ask the following questions to check their purchasing power:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nHave you ever purchased a solution like this before?\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nHave you done any business funding in the past?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat does the company\u2019s operating cash flow look like?\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\nAsking these questions will help you know the financial position of the company. \u00a0\nThen, once you see the purchasing capability, it\u2019s time you know the right person to contact.\u00a0\nA- Authority\u00a0\u00a0\nThe second qualification attribute is knowing the role contacted leads in decision-making.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nYou must try to connect to the decision-maker in the first place rather than the one who\u2019ll stretch the process.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nHowever, if you\u2019re connected with someone who isn\u2019t the decision maker or hasn\u2019t the authority to take the final call, then you should get help from them to get in touch with the right person.\u00a0\u00a0\nYou can ask the following questions to check if they have the authority to make the final call:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWho all are part of the decision-making?\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nWhat other purchase decisions have you taken in the past for the company?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWho is responsible for making the final call?\nWhat does the decision-making process look like in your company?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThese questions can help you discover the prospect\u2019s authority and inform you about other important people to include in the discussions.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nThe third attribute to qualify the lead is their interest in your offerings.\u00a0\nI- Interest\u00a0\nOnce you know that your prospect has funding capability and authority, it\u2019s time you create their interest in your offering.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nThe right way to do so- generating need or value for your offering to their business.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nSo, when the prospect feels that your product/service is adding value, can solve their issue, or overcome roadblocks, they will quickly get interested in your offerings.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nHence, you must do that carefully, as it can be a deal maker or the breaker.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nHere are some questions that can help you know if they are interested in your product/service:\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\nHow does this solution look to you?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat are your impressions of our offer?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nDoes implementation of this solution make sense for now?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThese questions will help you discover their interest in your product.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe next qualifier is to see if they see your product as needed.\u00a0\u00a0\nN- Need\u00a0\nAt this part of the qualification, you need to turn your product into a need for your prospect.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe FAINT methodology says that leads will only be needy of your product if they know the value it adds towards the growth.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nFollowing the FAINT qualification strategy, you can be more focused on experimenting with ways to generate interest/need for your product/services in the eyes of your prospects.\u00a0\u00a0\nAt this qualification stage, you can create opportunities to place your product as a \u201cmust-have\u201d t"

            "content": "Key TakeawaysIncremental sales is a metric that helps determine the difference between actual sales you generate during a specific timeframe and the estimated sales you would have generated.Incremental sales is an extremely important metric or KPI for sales managers, sales teams, and the business itself.Incremental sales formula: Incremental sales = Total Sales \u2013 Baseline SalesMarketing is all about being memorable to potential customers.By consistently engaging with them and making a good impression, you increase the chances that they will immediately think of your brand when they need a product or service you offer.\u00a0And the primary objective of putting in marketing efforts is to increase demand and boost revenue.But the only way you can ensure that your efforts are paying off is by measuring the right metric of the campaign.\u00a0Which is that metric? \u2013 Incremental Sales!\u00a0Indeed many other factors are essential, such as conversion rate, cost per lead, engagement, and more.But incremental sales is a metric that will help evaluate whether your marketing effort is showing results or not.But before we see how you can measure incremental sales, let\u2019s take a quick look at what exactly is incremental sales.What is incremental sales?\u00a0Incremental sales is a metric that helps determine the difference between actual sales you generate during a specific timeframe and the estimated sales you would have generated.And, because the growth in sales is usually a result of promotional campaigns, it\u2019s also referred to as a sales metric or a KPI (key performance indicator) that helps evaluate marketing effectiveness and performance of campaigns.The two most important things here are baseline sales, which refers to the revenue you generate without marketing efforts. And the second thing is campaigns, which in this context, are the marketing channels you choose to reach your potential customers.\u00a0So, this includes campaigns such as PPC advertisements, influencer marketing, social media advertisement, influencer marketing, and other such campaigns.\u00a0Why do you need to measure incremental sales?\u00a0Measuring incremental sales truly has its perks.It is a KPI that can shape the way your sales numbers grow. And, if the revenue you\u2019ve evaluated after measuring incremental sales is high, the campaign\u2019s performance is good.Whereas, if the numbers are negative, there are areas where improvement could be made.Incremental sales can help identify loopholes in the sales process, enables better allocation of marketing funds, and helps identify shortcomings. As a result, increased profit is achieved.Moreover, keeping track of incremental sales can help better strategize your upcoming promotional campaigns. \u00a0How to calculate incremental sales?\u00a0\u00a0The incremental sales formula highlights the growth in sales due to promotional activities during a set timeframe.Let\u2019s learn how to calculate incremental sales to evaluate the success of marketing campaigns.Incremental sales formula:\u00a0Incremental Sales = Total Sales \u2013 Baseline Sales\u00a0Now, let\u2019s clear out the concepts mentioned in the formula. \u00a0Total sales: It is the revenue your business generated during a set timeframe when the marketing campaigns were active. \u00a0Baseline sales: Itis the revenue you had projected your business would have generated during a set timeframe without marketing campaigns.\u00a0Calculating baseline sales can be a little tricky! However, educated guesswork can help make this easier.A common approach is calculating the company\u2019s average annual sales growth (without the marketing promotion). \u00a0Now, let\u2019s plug in some real numbers in the formula and take a look at an incremental sales example for a better understanding:\u00a0Let\u2019s assume total sales for,2021: $170,000\u00a02022: $200,000\u00a0As mentioned earlier, let\u2019s roughly take an average of the last three years of average annual sales growth (promotion-free) for baseline sales.2018-2019 = $20,000\u00a02019-2020 = $25,000\u00a02020-2021\u00a0= $30,000\u00a0Average annual sales growth = $20000 + $25000 + $30000 = $75,000\u00a0Average annual sales growth = $75000 \u00f7 3 = $25,000\u00a0Now as we know the average annual sales growth, can plug that into \u00a0Baseline sales for 2022 = $170000 (2021) + $25000 (average annual sales growth) = $145,000\u00a0So, the final figure would be:\u00a0Incremental Sales = $200000 \u2013 $145000 = $55,000\u00a0Now that we\u2019ve seen how to calculate incremental sales let\u2019s look at the best practices.Best practices for improving incremental sales\u00a0Here are a few important things you should keep in mind to improve incremental sales:\u00a01. Utilize an efficient CRM for analytics:\u00a0You\u2019re well aware that keeping track of incremental sales and other important metrics of marketing campaigns isn\u2019t a piece of cake. Instead, it requires a precise evaluation of the metrics.Also, if you don\u2019t already use software to manage sales revenue and other crucial indicators, you might want to start by thinking about a potent CRM like Salesmate. \u00a0With interactive sales dashboards and simple analytics, Salesmate mak"

Let\u2019s have a look at them.\u00a0\n1. Rise in buying poor quality leads from vendors\nOnline advertising drives quick results, and lead vendors leverage these channels to generate leads for other businesses.\nThus, many mortgage lenders aiming to leap to success purchase leads from lead vendors.\nUnfortunately, those leads are neither aware of the company\u2019s values nor filtered according to its requirements. \u00a0\nSo, when a sales rep approaches these unqualified leads, there is hardly any chance of gaining the opportunity of conversion.\u00a0\n2.

And that\u2019s why qualifying the leads before declaring them an SQL (sales qualified lead) is important.\u00a0\nLead scoring is an inevitable step in the lead qualification process. And since SaaS is all about the speedy functioning of processes, gathering lead data, and improvising customer relationships. It is important to understand the lead-scoring process of this industry.\u00a0\u00a0\nSo, this blog focuses on providing you with everything you need to know about SaaS lead scoring.\nHow is SaaS lead scoring different from traditional lead scoring?\u00a0\nThe process of qualifying leads in SaaS is relatively different compared to other industries. And that\u2019s why SaaS lead scoring has dynamic criteria.\u00a0\nUnlike SaaS lead scoring, which utilizes basic demographic information such as job title or industry, SaaS lead scoring takes into account multiple factors. Here are a few lead scoring factors that are primarily utilized to evaluate prospects:\u00a0\nDemographic data\u00a0\nExplicit data: This is the demographic data of the lead. So this includes factors like job title, deal value, company name, age, gender, and more.\u00a0\u00a0\nImplicit data: This is the lead\u2019s behavioral data. So this includes factors like time spent on the website, responsiveness to social media ads, newsletter subscriptions, contact form requests, and more.\u00a0\nScoring\u00a0\nSaaS lead scoring now uses algorithms to constantly adjust the scoring system based on previously processed leads. Due to this, the quality of leads that are being qualified constantly gets updated, and the process ensures that the least promising leads aren\u2019t filtered through.\u00a0\nPersonalized scoring\u00a0\nIn contrast to traditional lead scoring, SaaS lead scoring is more personalized. It takes into consideration a prospect\u2019s behavior across multiple digital channels. It\u2019s like having a complete tool to work with rather than just a hammer.\u00a0\nAutomation is possible\u00a0\nWith SaaS lead scoring tool, automation is possible. As a result, a lot of time and resources are saved. So, sales teams and marketers can focus their time on more important tasks.\u00a0\nAutomation also ensures that good leads are scored consistently and more accurately, which can help improve the overall efficiency of the lead qualification process.\u00a0\nBenefits of SaaS lead scoring\u00a0\nLead scoring is paramount in the lead qualification process.

This way, they can qualify the most promising leads for the business.\u00a0\u00a0\nSaaS lead scoring can help bridge the gap between marketing and sales teams. Alignment of sales and marketing teams can help drive a more optimized lead scoring model. \u00a0\nIt can also ensure that quality leads are passed to the sales teams at the right time, increasing the chances of closing more deals.\u00a0\u00a0Overall, the collaboration of the teams can result in better ROI and increased efficiency in sales efforts. \u00a0\n2. Better sales forecasting\u00a0\nLead scoring plays a vital role in forecasting sales. While you define lead scoring factors and criteria for analyzing sales-ready leads, you learn a lot about the lead.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nYou can match the information with your ICP (ideal customer profile) and analyze future sales. This way, the lead who resembles the most with your ICP has a higher chance of sales than the one with less resemblance with your ICP.\u00a0\n3. Saves time & resources for marketing and sales teams\u00a0\nThe core purpose of implementing lead scoring in the lead qualification process is to qualify the most promising leads that are valuable for the business. Because of this process integration, sales teams spend their time on valuable leads.\u00a0\nThis also means that sales teams can focus on engaging and nurturing potential leads instead of investing time and effort in all the invaluable leads.\u00a0\n4.

            "title": "Return on sales 101: Understanding the ratio, importance, formula, and real-life example",
            "content": "Key TakeawaysReturn on sales (ROS) is a metric that calculates the profit concerning operational costs. It explains the logic between revenue and operations.Return on sales is calculated by dividing operating profit by net revenue.ROS benefits your business by helping you improve operative potential, cutting material and labor costs, and aims at improving revenue by increasing sales figures.\nAll the revenue generated isn\u2019t business profit.\nTo evaluate your company\u2019s actual health and profitability status in a given time, you need to measure the revenue in relation to operating costs.\nThere are various ways to assess where your business is moving, profitable or not.\nOne of the most effective ways of calculating this is using the Return on sales (ROS) metric.\nThis blog covers the definition of return on sales, the formula, and influencing factors. So, let\u2019s begin.\nWhat is a return on sales ratio?\u00a0\nThe return on sales ratio measures how your company effectively generates profits from its sales. It measures the company\u2019s performance by calculating the actual profit made.\nROS is calculated when you divide your operating profit by net sales generated.\u00a0\nIt is one of the most\u00a0influential metrics that explain the logic behind the budget and sales strategies.\u00a0\nThinking about what increasing or decreasing ROS depicts? See the table below.\u00a0\nInvestors and creditors are the ones most interested in learning about a company\u2019s return on sales ratio. They use this ratio to measure the performances between two companies for a given period.\u00a0\nLet\u2019s learn more about the importance of the return on sales.\u00a0\nWhy is the return on sales important?\u00a0\nThe return on sales ratio is important for every business, along with creditors and investors.\nIt helps creditors and investors make various decisions like reinvesting in the company, the company\u2019s ability to pay back debts or pay potential dividends, etc.\nIt helps businesses measure yearly performance as the expenses and revenue keep varying yearly. So, the year making the highest revenue can only be considered profitable if the operating costs are included.\nYou can identify your company\u2019s growth by comparing it to your competitors. However, it would be effective only when comparing companies of similar business lines and the same size.\nFor example, \u201cCompany A\u201d makes $100,000 in revenue and spends $70,000 on operations for a given year. Conversely, \u201cCompany B\u201d makes the same revenue but spends $50,000 on operations for the same year.\nCompany B, excelling in cost-cutting, will have a better return on sales ratio. Hence it will make higher profits and attract potential investors.\nWhat is the return on sales formula, and how to calculate it?\nROS is calculated by dividing the operating profit or operating margin by your net sales revenue from your sales. Check out the return on sales formula below.\u00a0\nReturn on Sales= (Operating Profit/Net Sales) x 100\u00a0\nThe percentage in the return on sales formula above signals the profit made for every dollar you earn.\u00a0\nYou can calculate the return on sales of your company with these four simple steps.\u00a0\n\nLet\u2019s understand with an example to calculate return on sales.\u00a0\nSuppose ABC is a software development company. And the company spent $1,200,000 as an expense this year, and its net sales for the year are $5,000,000.\u00a0\nNow, once you subtract all your expenses, you\u2019re the Revenue made, and you will get your profit. See below.\u00a0\nOperating Profit= Revenue \u2013 Expenses\u00a0\n= $5,000,000 \u2013 $3,800,000\u00a0\n= $1,200,000\u00a0\nSo, now you have $1,200,00 as your operating margin. So, now we will use the value in return on sales formula. See below.\nReturn on Sales (ROS) = (Operating profit \u00f7 Net sales) x 100\u00a0\n= ($1,200,000 \u00f7 $5,000,000) x 100\u00a0\n\u00a0= 24%\u00a0\nAdditionally, it\u2019s also important to remember that even if the ROS is 24% in this case, it doesn\u2019t mean that the company is profitable.\u00a0\nOne thing to know about this metric is that it\u00a0does not consider non-operating expenses\u00a0such as interest, income tax, and other financial expenses.\u00a0\nNot including these figures enables the creditors and investors to understand the expenses associated with the business\u2019s core operations.\u00a0\nReturn on sales tells about the company\u2019s operational efficiency. So that\u2019s why it is also known as the operating profit margin.\u00a0\nComparison of ROS to other financial ratios \u00a0\nTo know your company\u2019s overall financial performance, you must compare your return on sales with other key financial ratios, such as return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE).\u00a0 \u00a0\nHere\u2019s to notice.\u00a0\n\nROS measures profitability concerning your sales. \u00a0\nROA measures profitability concerning your assets.\u00a0\nROE measures profitability concerning your equity.\u00a0\n\nROS is a good metric to evaluate profitability concerning sales revenue.\nBut, remember, it does not consider non-operating expenses like financing structure and taxes. Therefore, looking at other financial ratios and metrics essential to assess the company\u2019s overall financial health is best.\n"

And the ultimate objective of any sales call is to make the prospect into a paying customer or at least move them further across the sales pipeline.\u00a0\nAnd the core purpose of the sales call is to better connect with the prospects and keep them informed about your brand\u2019s products or services. And, most importantly, how they can benefit from using them.\u00a0\nEffective sales calls also enable you to upsell or cross-sell your existing customers.\u00a0\nVarious types of sales calls are made during the entire sales cycle to accomplish different objectives.

Each type of sales call has a different purpose.\u00a0\nLet\u2019s look at different types of sales calls:\n1. Cold calls\u00a0\u00a0\nCold calling is basically contacting potential customers without any prior contact or relationship. It\u2019s usually done in an effort to transform the prospect into a possible lead for the business.\u00a0\nFor instance, the calls made by credit card companies to sell a card to random people.\nAlso, keep in mind that 92% of prospects consider unidentified calls as spam.\u00a0And 80% of sales calls go to voicemail. So, there is always the possibility that the person that\u2019s being contacted may or may not be the potential customer for the business.\nPurpose of Cold Calls\nCold calling is usually done to identify a prospect\u2019s interests and whether they align with your brand\u2019s offerings or not. Based on this, you can attract and engage with them. So, qualifying the prospect becomes much easier.\u00a0\nTips to make successful sales calls\u00a0\u00a0\nCold calling is dead! That\u2019s what is usually said. But that can\u2019t be more untrue.

Accordingly, schedule the calls for such specified times to enhance sales opportunities.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nSupport of a sales CRM might help boost your sales productivity with features like call recording & forwarding, automatic voicemail drops, call tracking, etc.\u00a0\u00a0\nContinue reading; 12 Best cold calling tips for sales calls [with examples].\n  \n\nCold calling made easier and faster with Power DialerLet Salesmate take care of connecting you to more prospects while you focus on selling.Explore Built-In Calling\n2.

So, with an existing personal connection, you have a 4.2 times more chance to get an appointment.\nHere the prospects have an existing relationship with the business.

And move ahead with accurate solutions throughout the sales pipeline.\u00a0\nThis insight helps strategically place your solution in the prospect\u2019s business process and allows your reps to move a step closer to your customer.\u00a0\nTimeline\u00a0\nAfter knowing all the crucial aspects of qualifying leads, it\u2019s essential to understand where the problem\u2019s solution stands on the priority list.\u00a0\u00a0\nThere can be various aspects that can be discovered based on timeline information.\u00a0\nFor instance. if a prospect\u2019s timeline is too short, it might be possible that your solution may not be able to accommodate them.\nOr, if the prospect\u2019s timeline is far out, it is usual that the prospect still needs to identify your solution as a priority.\nThis allows your reps to treat the prospects as per their urgency to get the solution (if your product/service is the right fit for th"

            "content": "50% of marketers believe lead generation is their top priority.\u00a0\u00a0\nSo, they invest their time, budget, and other important resources to drive in the results.\u00a0\nBut this also means that 50% don\u2019t believe lead generation is that important. Why is that?\u00a0\nBecause one thing is missing for that 50%; a thorough understanding of the lead generation process. \u00a0\nAnd due to this, it\u00a0costs businesses time and essential resources. So, we\u2019ve created this\u00a0guide\u00a0to help make the process of lead generation and its execution seamless.\u00a0\nSo why not skip the table of content and get to the good part?\u00a0\nBut before that, let\u2019s clear out some basics!\u00a0\nTable of ContentsWhat is a lead and its types?\u00a0What is lead generation?\u00a0Why is lead generation important for businesses?\u00a0Lead generation statistics and marketing trends\u00a0Lead generation types with powerful examples\u00a04 Steps for developing a lead generation process\u00a0\u00a0Actionable lead generation strategies in 2023 that you must try\u00a0Lead Generation tools to streamline productivity, revenue, and whatnot!\u00a0Lead generation ideas to generate high-quality leads\u00a0\u00a0Why not just buy leads?\u00a0\u00a0Conclusion\u00a0FAQs on lead generation\u00a0\nWhat is a lead and its types?\u00a0\nA lead is someone who has shown interest in your brand\u2019s product or service in any way. \u00a0\nFor instance, downloading a freebie content resource, asking a question in live chat, filling out a contact us form, taking a free trial, etc. A lead is basically\u00a0your prospective customer.\u00a0\nLet\u2019s understand this better with an example.\u00a0\nMy friend Taylor is a marketing head of a real estate company, and his boss had asked him to find suitable email marketing software for their business.\u00a0\u00a0\nLike every normal person would do, he went on the internet and started his for the \u201cbest email marketing software for real estate.\u201d \u00a0\nAnd Taylor explored almost\u00a0every other site that appeared on the search results to check the features, compare prices, book demo sessions, and more.\u00a0\nIn addition to that, he even checked the company\u2019s social media activities to double-check the brand\u2019s authority.\u00a0\nSo, let\u2019s say that the software which Taylor explored the most is \u2018X\u2019. Now, if \u2018X\u2019 is your product, then Taylor is a definite lead for you.\u00a0\nMoving on! Basically, there are six different types of leads that you should be aware of before we dive deeper into the lead generation process.\n\n1. Cold sales lead\u00a0\nCold leads are potential customers you found whilst searching for a new business but haven\u2019t yet contacted. You have their contact information to reach out to them, but you don\u2019t know their intent regarding your brand. \u00a0\nAlso, cold leads sometimes are totally unaware of your brand\u2019s existence. So, you might need to make extensive efforts to find out whether they can be your potential customers or not.\u00a0\n2. Warm sales lead\u00a0\nWarm leads are the ones that have shown interest in your product or services but haven\u2019t reached a decision stage where they would make a purchase. But, if nurtured, a good sales opportunity could be fostered.\u00a0\n3. Hot sales lead\u00a0\nHot leads are the ones that have already stated their pain point and are looking for specific solutions. They have also shown keen interest in your brand\u2019s offerings. \u00a0\nBut while dealing with hot leads, it is best if your sales professionals are experts in solving their last-minute queries. So, there\u2019s no doubt that the deal will be sealed.\u00a0\n4. IQL (Information qualified leads)\u00a0\nIQLs are generated when they share their contact information in exchange for some valuable content resource. The prospect may or may not know about your brand.\u00a0\nAlso, there\u2019s no guarantee that IQLs can be your ideal prospect. Maybe they found the resource helpful and signed up to get access to it.\u00a0\n5. MQLs (Marketing Qualified Leads)\u00a0\nMQLs are potential prospects for your company. They consistently engage with your brand but aren\u2019t convinced enough to make a purchasing decision. But with a little nurturing, they can become paying customers.\u00a0\n6. SQLs (Sales Qualified Leads)\u00a0\nSQLs are the contacts who are convinced of the offerings of your brand and are ready to make the purchasing decision. They are the people who are just awaiting a call from your sales team to seal the deal.\u00a0\nNow that we\u2019re clear on what exactly a lead is and its types let\u2019s take it up a notch!\u00a0\nWhat is lead generation?\u00a0\nLead generation is the process of increasing awareness about your product or services among your target audience and nurturing them to improve conversion.\u00a0\nLead generation is your first step towards creating a loyal customer base. It is a multitude of processes that includes efforts in driving potential web traffic, tactics to entice web visitors through content, using lead management tools to capture leads, and nurturing the most assuring ones to get sales.\u00a0\nLead generation is a process that can be done in various ways. Such as digital marketing, offline marketing, Ad campaigns, and more.\u00a0\nBut, if you\u2019re someone who aims to drive in leads using digital marketing, then do check out our"

            "content": "Key Takeaways67% of potential customers don't convert into sales, primarily due to an ineffective lead qualification process.Lead qualification is the process of determining if a lead is the best fit for your business or not and is a crucial task at the initial stage of the sales and marketing process.The lead qualification process includes four steps: developing an ideal customer profile (ICP), defining lead qualification criteria, creating an automated lead scoring process, and classifying marketing and sales qualified leads.Top lead qualification frameworks includes BANT Framework, MEDDIC Framework, and CHAMP Sales Framework.\n67% of potential customers don\u2019t convert into sales.\u00a0\nSo, does this mean that sales reps aren\u2019t putting in enough effort to convert leads?\u00a0\u00a0\nNo! It\u2019s primarily due to the ineffective lead qualification process done by sales reps, according to Spotio.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s a lot of lost leads!\nThis also means that only 33% of the leads get converted, and they weren\u2019t even qualified on whether or not they\u2019re right for the business. And that\u2019s a big problem!\u00a0\nSo how can you filter the leads that are most valuable for your business easily?\u00a0\nBy setting up an efficient lead qualification process that filters leads who have a higher chance of converting.\u00a0\nWhat is lead qualification?\u00a0\nLead qualification is the process of determining if a lead is the best fit for your business or not.\nIt is one of the crucial tasks at the initial stage of the sales and marketing processes.\u00a0\u00a0\nIt is a vital step as it helps allocate the efforts of sales and marketing teams efficiently.\nThis segmentation helps you to understand your buyer persona in detail, personalize communication, shorten the cycle, sell confidently, and build an efficient sales engine.\u00a0\nNow, let\u2019s get to the important part!\u00a0\n4 Steps to successfully qualify leads\nLet\u2019s understand the process of lead qualifying in 4 simple steps:\u00a0\n\n1. Develop an ideal customer profile (ICP)\u00a0\nInitially, you want to conduct in-depth research on your customers and create an ideal customer profile.\nThis would help you learn about all the vital information you need to know about your customers.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nTo start with, prepare a questionnaire consisting of the questions you would want the answers to from your customers. Here are a few examples for you to get started:\u00a0\n\nWho would use this product/service?\u00a0\nWhat would be their job title or position?\u00a0\nWhich industry do they belong to?\u00a0\nWhat problem does my product/service solve?\u00a0\nWhat are their demographics? (For e.g.: age, gender, education, employment, etc.)\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat is the psychographics of the customer? (For e.g.: values, interests, lifestyle, etc.)\u00a0\n\nThese were just a few of the many questions that can help you learn more about your customers.\nAnd by answering these questions, you can avoid wasting effort and time on prospects that are unlikely to become customers.\nAlso, don\u2019t forget to take a close look at the data you\u2019ve collected about customers like a detective on a case.\nSee if any patterns and trends pop out. This will help you identify the common characteristics of your ideal customer.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nTo analyze the data in a more precise manner and create an actionable plan. Your CRM would be pretty helpful in acquiring datasets.\nAdditionally, here are a few things to keep in mind while creating your ideal customer profile:\u00a0\n\nKeep it simple, don\u2019t make it too complex.\u00a0\nDon\u2019t limit yourself to one customer profile; create multiple variants.\u00a0\nEnsure it\u2019s actionable, so you can use it to make swift decisions.\u00a0\nFinally, keep in mind that your ICP may change over time.\n\n2. Define lead qualification criteria\n\nThe next step you want to focus on is defining the lead qualification criteria.\nFundamentally, it means that on what basis would you qualify leads for your business?\u00a0\u00a0\nThese criteria are specific to each business and can vary based on factors such as the industry, product or service, and target market.\u00a0\nHere are a few qualification criteria you can utilize for lead qualification:\u00a0\n\nIs the prospect in the target demographic of the business? An answer to that could be, \u201cI\u2019ll only treat prospects from the United States.\u201d\u00a0\nDoes the prospect have the budget or resources to make a purchase? An answer to that could be, \u201cI\u2019ll only treat prospects with a $50K ticket size or more.\u201d\u00a0\nIs the prospect a decision-maker within their organization? An answer to that could be, \u201cI might start off the conversation with executives, but I\u2019ll do the deal with C-level executives who are decision-makers.\u201d\u00a0\nWhat is the company size? An answer to that could be, \u201cOnly companies with 100+ employees are my target market.\u201d\nHave they interacted with the digital fronts of your business? (For e.g.: website, social media, etc.)\u00a0\nHas the lead interacted with any of the ads being run by the business?\u00a0An answer to that could be, \u201cI\u2019ll prefer prospects who come from ad sources as CAC is high for them.\u201d\n\nAnswering these questions can help you qualify a prospect for a lead.\nAnd, i"

This helps you to detect problems at an early stage and strategize accordingly.\u00a0\nUltimately, sales tracking is similar to taking a precaution than a cure.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor example, you have a sales funnel dashboard in your CRM, and you notice a significantly lower percentage of leads moving toward the middle of the funnel from the top of the funnel stage.\u00a0\nIn such a scenario, you can take the necessary steps, like focusing more on customer engagement or altering\u00a0the strategy, etc., to ensure that the problem gets solved.\u00a0\u00a0\nThis way, sales performance tracking can help you prevent future blunders by detecting problems at an early stage.\u00a0\nHere are some more examples of predictions you can make based on sales performance tracking:\u00a0\n\nYou have a healthy demo booking, but the demo completion rate is very low. That shows your prospects are booking the demo but not joining on time. You can solve this problem by automating a simple\u00a0email prior to the demo time.\u00a0\nThe total number of no-show demos is high, but the rescheduling of demos is very low. That means your prospects are missing demos in the first place and not booking the demos again. Maybe you can give a phone call and text message with a calendar link when prospects miss their demo. To increase the chances of reschedules. \u00a0\nIf the demo requests per day are declining, you can connect with the marketing team to find out the problem. Maybe there has been a significant impact on the website traffic. Or you simply need to push the demo booking more on your website. \u00a0\nIf the demos attended by an individual rep is declining, you need to invest more time in training the rep. Work with them and shadow a few calls to truly understand the problems they are facing. \u00a0\nThe report on \u201cDeals in pipeline by sales reps\u201d shows you the true impact of individuals on the bottom line. \u00a0\n\n  \n\nTrack your top performers in revenueVisualize a data-rich dashboard in Salesmate with game-changing insights.Explore Sales Reports\n2. Works as an alarm clock\u00a0\nSales is all about timing. \u00a0\nYour sales reps have to reach\u00a0prospects, communicate, and close \u2013 all at the right time.\u00a0\nThere\u2019s an obvious chance your reps may miss out on important leads. \u00a0\nAnd this is where sales performance tracking enters the picture.\u00a0\nIt provides real-time updates that work as a reminder for your team\u2019s deadlines. \u00a0\nFor example, a report on \u201cDeals in pipeline by stages\u201d will show you where exactly the block is. In order to meet targets, you can get a clear idea of where your team should spend time communicating. \nFor example, prospects in the \u2018Decision\u2019 stage are more likely to convert than the \u2018Consideration\u2019 stage.\u00a0\nHence, sales performance tracking works as an alarm clock that lets you measure the gap between the set goal and the achieved target of the entire sales team.\u00a0\u00a0\n3. Helps in the decision-making process\u00a0\nIt is vital to optimizing your strategy at specific intervals. \u00a0\nThis can be done only when you have a reliable progress report of the implemented strategy.\u00a0\nSales performance tracking allows you to measure the efficiency of each stage. \u00a0\nFurther, it helps you avoid useless activities that are not contributing to your success.\u00a0\nFor example,\u00a0reports on\u00a0sequences show the performance of each email with clear sales metrics. If you find out the last email of your sequence has only a 2% open rate, you can either get rid of it or optimize the subject line a bit. \u00a0\nOf course, this was just a small example, but sales tracking can help you with much bigger decisions\u00a0\u2013 even finalizing\u00a0your ideal channel of communication.\u00a0\n4. Provides real-time sales insights\u00a0\nSales tracking can offer the following insights in real-time:\u00a0\n\nWho is leading the sales leaderboard in your team?\u00a0\nWho has the most contribution in revenue this month?\u00a0\nWho has the highest commission earned?\u00a0\nWhich sales rep has the highest assistance rate in deal closing?\u00a0\nWhich sales reps are closing deals without any assistance?\u00a0\nWhat does your revenue donut look like?\u00a0\nWhat are the top industries from your sales closure?\u00a0\nWho had the greatest number of calls in a day, week, or month?\u00a0\n\n25 key sales metrics you should be tracking\nHere is a list of all the important metrics you should be tracking as a sales manager.

            "content": "Key TakeawaysYou can create a cohesive sales outreach strategy for inbound and outbound. Find out how!Salespeople end up 50% of their daily time on emailing, data entry, and scheduling calls.You can find out parts that you can easily automate in your sales outreach.\nHear me out.\u00a0\nSalespeople spend only one-third of their day actually talking to prospects.\u00a0\nI mean, as a sales professional, you should be spending at least half of your day talking about sales.\u00a0\nSo, what exactly eats up sales reps\u2019 time?\u00a0\nThe statistics say\u2026\u00a0\n\nEmailing (21%)\u00a0\nData entry (17%)\u00a0\nProspecting & researching leads (17%)\u00a0\nInternal meetings (12%)\u00a0\nScheduling calls (12%)\u00a0\n\nI can see three tasks you can completely automate, sparing you 50% more time every day!\u00a0Now, think for your entire sales team!\nWhat you need is a well-thought sales outreach strategy (and the power of automation).\u00a0\nThat\u2019s the topic of our discussion today.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat is a sales outreach strategy? Why should you care about it? and why you NEED to automate as much as you can.\u00a0\nWhat is a sales outreach strategy?\u00a0\nSales outreach strategy is the planning of how your sales team will communicate with prospects throughout the customer journey.\u00a0\nBasically, every communication from prospecting to sales closing will fall under this outreach plan.\u00a0\u00a0\n75% of B2B brands witness a whopping 4 months to acquire a new customer. A relatively older statistic, but the average sales cycle has increased by 24% from 2012 to 2014.\u00a0\u00a0\nDon\u2019t you think, as we progress, our sales cycle should get shortened?\u00a0\nWell, market dynamics are definitely not in our control, but how you outreach and pivot is definitely in your control.\u00a0\nOur aim for this article is to minimize our cycle and automate different parts of sales outreach.\u00a0\nTypes of sales outreach\u00a0\nAs we all know, salespeople communicate with two mindsets:\u00a0\nInbound sales outreach: The prospects come to you and show interest using various digital mediums.\u00a0\nOutbound sales outreach: You reach out to prospects with a calculated guess that they might be interested in your product/services.\u00a0\nThe main difference between inbound and outbound sales is that, in inbound sales, most sales efforts start at a later stage of the journey, while outbound sales start at an early stage.\u00a0\u00a0\n5 Steps to create a cohesive sales outreach strategy\nOur goal is to create a strategy that you can use for inbound and outbound both.\nYou know there are some common parts in inbound and outbound. We want to identify exactly those parts, and automate them!\nThese are the steps where you can create a successful sales outreach strategy and execute it well, whether it\u2019s for inbound or outbound:\n\nDefine where you need automation and where you need manual communication\u00a0\nCreate reusable templates\u00a0\nSet up automation for repetitive outreach\u00a0\nExperiment with various templates\u00a0\nWhat else can be automated in inbound and outbound outreach?\u00a0\n\nStep 1: Automation or manual communication?\u00a0\nThe first step to an effective sales outreach strategy is to know where exactly you want to leverage automation and where you want to use personalized communication.\u00a0\nIf you manage to find these items, you can create a solid plan for yourself, no matter inbound or outbound.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe next question should be \u2013 Is there any common communication occurring in inbound and outbound both?\u00a0\nYou should automate them.\u00a0\nThese are some of the most common communications occurring in both cases:\u00a0\u00a0\n\nProduct/service education communication\u00a0\nNurturing emails to push prospects down the funnel\u00a0\nFollow-ups to book a meeting\u00a0\nWelcome or onboarding emails once prospects signup for a free trial\u00a0\nConfirmation emails for a product demo\u00a0\u00a0\nPricing related communication\u00a0\nContract overview communication\u00a0\nAccount sales communication to provide better services\u00a0\n\nAll these tasks can be automated if you have a streamlined business process.\u00a0\u00a0\nThere are some communications where automation is not possible. For example, discovery calls in outbound or negotiation phone calls.\u00a0\u00a0\nBut you can still leverage automation, partially.\u00a0\u00a0\nStep 2: Create re-usable templates\u00a0\nOnce you figure out the parts you need to automate, create email templates for them.\u00a0\nInvest heavy time in these templates. They are your assets.\u00a0\u00a0\nThese assets are going to save you a lot of time for you, so test them before putting them in the process.\u00a0\n  \n\nTurn email templates into sales assetsReuse same templates in multiple sales outreaches, easily!Start your free trial\nStep 3: Set up automation for repetitive outreach\u00a0efforts\nThe next stage is to set up automation for all the repetitive communications.\u00a0\nYou need to be very careful with the triggers, conditions, and actions.\u00a0\nThese are some of the examples of sales automation you can use here.\u00a0\nTrigger\u00a0Condition\u00a0Action\u00a0If new deal is created\u00a0If deal is moved to \u201cInterested\u201d stage\u00a0Send a product education email with resourcesIf deal is moved to \u201cBook a meeting\u201d stage\u00a0If Tag is equal to \u201cDemo\u201d\u00a0Send an email with calendar link to book a meeting\u00a0\u00a0Se"

            "content": "Search engines used to be a huge channel for growing businesses. They didn\u2019t have to invest heavily in ads and could still convert searches into potential buyers.\u00a0\u00a0\nBut every year, I see the organic search evolving. Organic SERP results are more \u201cinformation-driven\u201d, making conversions much harder.\u00a0\u00a0\nIt is obvious that businesses will turn to ads to generate leads, marketing, and advertising.\nAccording to Statista, in five years(2019-2024), U.S. digital ad spending is forecasted to grow\u00a0from 132.46 to 278.53 billion dollars.\nThese lead generation ads aim to make the prospect share their contact details by filling out the lead form and getting them in the lead bucket. There are various methods of running lead generation ads.\u00a0\nSome platforms redirect the user to your website, while some platforms allow lead forms within the platform\u2014for example, Instagram, LinkedIn, Google Ads, etc. However, practically what matters is the ultimate goal of making prospects sign up for the lead form.\u00a0\nLet\u2019s start with the basics.\u00a0\nWhat are lead generation ads?\u00a0\nLead generation ads are digital advertisements that collect prospect data from various channels hoping to meet their primary goal of conversion.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn simple words, lead generation ads are all digital ads that bring in new customers or prospects.\u00a0\u00a0\nThese ads also aim to collect relevant contact information of people who clicks on your ads. Here\u2019s an example of a lead generation ad for \u201clead generation ads\u201d:\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhen users click the CTA on the ad campaign, it directs them to a dedicated landing page/homepage, or a popup appears.\u00a0\u00a0\nSome platforms offer pre-populated information from their social media profiles. Usually, the prospects have to fill up the data in the lead generation forms by themselves.\u00a0\nLead gen ads make the signup experience more cohesive for the users; hence it observes a high conversion rate.\u00a0\n5 Most popular lead generation ads channels\u00a0\n\nGoogle Ads\u00a0\nLinkedIn\u00a0\u00a0\nFacebook\u00a0\nInstagram\u00a0\nTwitter\u00a0\n\nWhy should you use lead generation ads?\u00a0\nThese are three key benefits enough to prove the efficacy of lead generation advertising offered to every growing business.\u00a0\n1. Cuts down the signup process\u00a0\nAs we discussed, some lead ads avoid directing users to a website, and rather a popup appears, specifically on social channels.\u00a0\nUsers don\u2019t want to leave the social platform and hinder their experience.\u00a0\nMany prospects can find it daunting to feed information manually, especially if there are too many form fields.\u00a0\nSuch lead gen ads are perfect for speeding up this lead generation process. Also, these are beneficial when you don\u2019t have a proper website in place.\u00a0\nYou can run these ads and collect prospect data directly. But you\u2019d have to initiate the communication in this case.\u00a0\u00a0\nThis is extremely useful for a small online store relying on an Instagram page and not having a proper website.\u00a0\u00a0\n2. Collect high-quality leads\u00a0\nLead generation ads are clicked mainly by people who are interested in the product or service you sell.\u00a0\nThese lead ads offer a higher conversion rate than other conventional lead generation tactics.\u00a0\nThe below example is of a lead generation ad for webinar signup. So, this ad only targets a specific demographic, helping you collect qualified leads.\u00a0\n\nThe quality of leads depends on how well you have optimized your lead ad.\u00a0\u00a0\n3. You don\u2019t need a website\u00a0\nAs we discussed, some ads directly collect leads using forms. This is amazing for new businesses that have no websites.\u00a0\nThey can directly move forward with new leads while building their website and branding. Of course, in this case, businesses must first contact potential customers and take the deal forward.\u00a0\n8 Tips & tricks to create impactful lead generation ads\u00a0with examples\nThough creating lead generation ads is a marketing team collaborative work, as an ads manager, the major responsibility of setting up successful lead gen ads is on your shoulder.\nHere are some tips and tricks that you can try to extract the most benefit from your lead gen ad examples.\n1. Ask questions that\u2019ll help you understand your ideal customers\u00a0\nUse custom questions to filter prospects. Get in touch with your sales team, and see if they wish to learn something specific about the leads being offered.\u00a0\n\nWhen a prospect is asked specific questions that are aligned with their requirements, you will receive relevant information as answers.\u00a0\nAlso, this information can be reviewed by the sales teams, so they don\u2019t ask the same questions repeatedly.\u00a0\nThese can be some sample questions for a car dealership lead ad:\u00a0\n\nWhen are you planning to buy a car?\u00a0\nWhat\u2019s your budget?\u00a0\nWill you need a car loan?\u00a0\nWhen would you like to request a test drive?\u00a0\n\n2. Integrate lead gen forms directly with your CRM\u00a0\nMake sure that you integrate your lead gen form with a CRM.\u00a0So, their data will be stored directly in the CRM whenever a visitor clicks on your lead ad and fills up the Web Form.\u00a0\nHere are some of the benefits of using an integrated CRM.\u00a0\n"

Therefore, knowing it is a mandate for accurate sales forecasting.\nThis blog talks about what is sales volume variance, the formula and how sales leaders can benefit from it to understand the business opportunity, sales and revenue.\u00a0\nWhat is sales volume variance?\u00a0\nSales volume variance is the difference between actual units sold and the budgeted (or standard) units sold at a specific price within a specified period.\u00a0\nIt is sometimes referred to as \u201csales quantity variance,\u201d as it is calculated based on the number of units sold.\u00a0\nSales volume variance formula explained with an example\u00a0\nIf you know the actual number of units sold compared to the budgeted units sold and the price per unit, calculate the sales volume variance using the formula below.\u00a0\nSales volume variance= [Actual units sold \u2013 Budgeted units sold] x Price per unit\u00a0\nIt is a measure that gives valuable insights into where your sales efforts are going.\u00a0\nLet\u2019s understand it with the help of an example:\u00a0\nLet\u2019s stick with our SaaS product example; now, you have projected that your sales team will sell 100 subscriptions in February.\u00a0\nBut, your team sold only 85 subscriptions, and each subscription is $15 per month.\u00a0\u00a0\nNow, let\u2019s calculate.\n\nThe negative sign indicated an unfavorable variance(explained in the next section of the blog).\u00a0\nOnce you have your sales volume variance result, it helps you understand how to improve your sales performance by optimizing various impacting parameters.\u00a0\nYou can optimize product pricing and budgeted units count to achieve a favorable variance that directly leads to a tendency for higher profit.\u00a0\nIf all other variables remain equal, you should have a more accurate projection next month.\u00a0\u00a0\nAbsorption costing vs. marginal costing\u00a0\nThere are two costing techniques, absorption and marginal costing, and you can implement either depending on your need.\u00a0\nFind the specification in the table below:\u00a0\nAbsorption costing\u00a0Marginal costing\u00a0You need to consider both fixed and variable cost.

In addition, it effectively contributes to helping leaders to make smart data-driven decisions.Understand how with an example.\u00a0\nLet\u2019s stick with our SaaS product example;\u00a0\u00a0\nThe basic plan is worth $12, and the growth plan is worth $24 per user per month when paid annually.\u00a0\nSuppose your reps sell 500 basic and 300 growth plan in one month.\u00a0\nFinancial analysis indicates that sales by the basic plan made $6,000 in revenue, and sales by the growth plan made $7200 in revenue.\u00a0\u00a0\nRevenue count expresses that the growth plan is more beneficial for the company\u2019s success, so you should command your sales reps to pitch aggressively for a growth plan.\u00a0\u00a0\nBut, the sales volume analysis brings us a different perspective on the business. It indicates that you have a larger audience that finds your basic plan useful for them as the company receives a new 500 subscription.\u00a0\nTherefore, calculating sales volume variance opens new perspectives to your sales that will contribute to a promising sales strategy.\u00a0\nIn this competitive space, you must know whether your sales efforts are in the right direction or not!\u00a0\nSales volume variance analysis\nSales volume variance can be considered a sales performance meter that tells about your financial outcomes failing or exceeding, or meeting your budgeted sales.\u00a0\nCheck out the table below:\nFavorable sales volume variance\u00a0\u00a0Unfavorable sales volume variance\u00a0\u00a0Your sales volume variance would be favorable when the actual sales quantity is more than the budgeted quantity.\u00a0Your sales volume variance would be unfavorable when the actual sales quantity is lesser than the budgeted quantity.\u00a0Actual unit sold > Budgeted unit sold\u00a0Actual unit sold < Budgeted unit sold\u00a0The value comes negative.The value co"

The calls were made by a total of 245 sales reps and the successful conversations were 1427.\u00a0All the sales reps belong to the USA, and so do the prospects they connected with during this study.\u00a0Let\u2019s check out the findings.Best day to make a sales callAccording to the results, Wednesday is the best day to make a sales call with 136 successful call conversations on the very first attempt. Right after Wednesday, Thursday is the second-best day to make a call to prospects with 113 successful conversations. Friday would be the worst day to make a sales call with only 63 conversations.\u00a0The difference in the number of conversations between the best day (Wednesday) and the worst day (Friday) is 53.67%.Make sales calls right from your CRMGet virtual numbers and start connecting with prospects!Try Salesmate for FreeBest time to make a sales callStarting from 9 am to 6 pm, in the evening between 4 pm to 5 pm would be the best time to make a sales call. The results also showed the worst time to make a sales call i.e. 5 pm to 6 pm in the evening. The second best time to make a sales call would be in the morning between 10 am to 11 am.The difference between the best time and the worst time to make a sales call is 88.88%.Response TimeIn this study, we also observed the response behavior of the prospects and we got some amazing results. The moment a lead is generated (or an inquiry is submitted), the first hour has the highest chances of conversation over a call.\u00a0With 137 successful conversations in the first attempts, the study shows that the first hour from the lead generation is the most important hour to make a sales call. The number of responses drops drastically by 11 times from the first hour to the 8th hour of lead generation.In simpler words, the chances of having a successful conversation with prospects drop each hour after the lead is generated.\u00a0ConsistencyIn this study, we have also made emphasis on the consistency of making sales calls to prospects. The number of attempts (or how many times to call a lead) made a lot of difference in the total number of conversations that took place (i.e. 1427).245 sales reps had a total of 489 successful conversations in the first attempt. In the second attempt, another 281 conversations took place. Interestingly, 328 more conversations were made in the third attempt by the sales reps. According to the results, sales reps managed to have conversations until the 6th attempt.\u00a0In simpler words, for a prospect, it is advisable to make 6 attempts to have a successful sales conversation.Average call attempts by sales repsOut of 245 sales reps under the observation, only 29 have made a total of 6 attempts to a prospect. While we\u2019ve already understood that a minimum of 6 attempts is advisable to reach a prospect, most sales reps give up on the third attempt.\u00a0How Salesmate can help?Salesmate is a sales CRM designed for small and medium-scale businesses.

I have shared 13 lead generation strategies that can help you generate leads with little effort.13 Game-changing lead generation strategies to try in 2023There are plenty of lead generation strategies; however, not all will apply to your business. Hence, you must experiment with a few strategies and approaches to find the right one.1. Landing page copywritingIn terms of online marketing, a landing page is also known as \u2013\nSingle property pageStatic pageLead capture pageDestination pageA standalone page that lands a user from a link on a digital channel or email. Its main objective is to get a visitor to open a conversation with your business.To achieve this, one can interlink eBooks, whitepapers, and datasheets or add CTAs in their blogs, guest posts, videos, and more.A prospect can access the same in exchange for their personal information such as email, phone number, and company name.In a nutshell, a trade-off between the prospect and the company.Landing pages differ from other website pages as they\u2019re designed as a part of a more extensive marketing campaign.Hence, it\u2019s important to prioritize the end goal and set up your content.Example:Calm is a SaaS health and wellness app that covers everything one can explore with its landing page.The headline \u201cMeet Calm\u201d instills a feeling of tranquility just by reading it. The other things that stand out about the landing page are:\nIt speaks about what they offer (better sleep, lower stress, and less anxiety) without overwhelming them with excess information.\u00a0It informs you of what you can get while not revealing all their services.It reassures you by mentioning that this service has helped millions on their path to wellness.One can almost experience a sense of calm with its soothing wallpaper in the background. Blue is one of the warmest colors; it creates a wave of serenity within\u2013 something we already crave.2. Free/Paid trial or demosFree trials or demos are among the best-performing CTAs for B2B lead generation.A free trial is a limited-period offer for prospective customers to try your product or services.Companies that want to target qualified leads also use paid trials.A free demo assists a user in understanding a service or product compared to what they currently use.\u00a0This tactic can help in generating leads and improve your customer base.For example, Salesmate offers a 15-day free trial without seeking a payment commitment.One can also schedule a demo to learn about the product features and how it can grow your business.So, a prospect can simply get a 15-day free trial and see if Salesmate is the right fit for their business.3.

Measure metrics10 sales cadence best practices to improve your outreachWhen you want to execute a successful sales cadence, you need to look after many different factors. And below, we have listed 10 sales cadence best practices that every sales rep needs to implement when creating an outreach sequence.1. Sales cadence based on buyer personaWhen your buyers are different, why have one single cadence for all?Your buyer may belong to different age groups, sex, location, and background. So should your sales cadences. It is suggested to have different cadence patterns for different personas.For instance, when you\u2019re targeting a marketing manager, you\u2019ll have different sales cadences compared to when you\u2019re reaching out to a CEO.To find the perfect sales cadence for your buyer persona, you need to experiment first. This way, you\u2019ll experience which sales cadence process works best for which buyer and eventually see an increase in numbers.2. Sales cadence based on lead typeSalespeople are actively engaged with outreach.Since you spend the maximum time of your day sending mailers and making strategies to meet your goals, you must be using multiple cadences.However, you\u2019ll need a different cadence based on lead type. Just like having an outbound prospecting cadence and an inside sales cadence.You should consider experimenting with sales cadence email templates and telephone scripts for leads coming through various channels, various demographic profiles, and with different goals.For outbound sales cadence, build yourself as a source of valuable information and not just another seller with a spray and pray pitch. Remember to offer before you ask for something in return.Moving ahead, you\u2019ll know what works best for which form of lead, and you\u2019ll be more effective at driving them down through the funnel.3. Define the number of touchpointsWhen you build a sales cadence, you should know the number of customer touchpoints you need to add.Simply sending too many emails or texts and spamming your prospect will prove to be a failure, making you lose your prospect.Instead, you need to make sure that your follow-ups are such that they act as reminders for your business and make your prospect feel that they are missing something if they don\u2019t get in touch with you in meantime.Therefore, you need to define the number of touchpoints you make to yield better results.\u00a04. Choose the right day and time to connectPracticing sales cadence is all about timing your communication with your prospect.It is often said that finding a proper time while pitching is very important. You just cannot reach out to your leads at any random time.Imagine a clothing brand sending you a flash sale offer at 3:00 AM, and you check it in the morning.

One such way of learning this is through mock sales calls.As a salesperson, you don\u2019t want to go into a call blindly \u2014 especially if you\u2019re newer to the game.

Let\u2019s learn how to conduct these mock calls that can help you make actual sales call.How to conduct mock calls?If you want to start a smooth conversation with your prospects while cold calling, you need to follow certain steps. And below points will help you cover every aspect that you need to keep in mind before making a real sales call.Step 1: Help them understand your product/service from the coreAn effective initial step for any newbie\u2019s training in the sales team should be educating them about company offerings.Sales are all about introducing products/services to potential customers. For this, it is obvious for the salesperson to have a clear knowledge of the products and offerings list.There may be a case where teams are divided on the basis of specified products or services.For instance, a company offering multiple products like UX/UI designs as well as digital marketing services may have divided its sales team into two parts. One focuses on UX/UI design and the other on digital marketing services.In such a scenario, the reps selling UX/UI designs should know about the basics of digital marketing services too in order to never miss any potential customer.\u00a0These sales strategies can help your team develop expertise on both fronts.This can be executed only when the rep is trained and educated totally about all the services and products that the company offers.Hence, it is important to start with training the salespeople on the products/services of the company.Step 2: Prepare notes on Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)\u00a0After learning about the company\u2019s product/services, it is vital to help the salesperson understand the criteria and picture an ideal customer.Not only efforts but efforts in the right direction and with the right audience will help salespeople achieve their goals. You need to form a picture of an ideal customer for your sales rep to target the same.\u00a0An ideal customer can be considered as a hypothetical avatar of a customer who has a need that matches perfectly with your solution and ends up being your profitable customer.For instance, being a real estate agency, you will target business entities, brand owners, and so on for your commercial complex. Whereas you\u2019ll target individuals for your residential complex.\u00a0This way, you\u2019ll be able to grab more customers for your business. Hence, make sure to prepare notes on the ideal customer profile.\u00a0Step 3: Be ready for questions\u00a0As a mock call trainer or even the trainee, you must be ready for questions.\u00a0\u00a0As a sales rep or trainee, you need to prepare yourself for the questions that will be thrown up at you by your manager. You need to have a clear understanding of your company\u2019s products and services to answer these questions thoroughly.\u00a0\u00a0These questions will increase your knowledge of the company and will prove to be the best exercise to make you an expert in your domain.\u00a0As a sales manager or trainer, you need to prepare yourself to put up some common questions which the trainee or the rep will face while practically making calls. These questions will help the reps stay prepared with the best answers and at the same time, will make them aware of the familiar concerns.\u00a0\u00a0This way, you need to prepare for questions.\u00a0Step 4: Choose your ideal environment\u00a0While conducting a mock call, choose the right environment.\u00a0You need to make sure that you\u2019re choosing a good place that is comfortable and quiet, so it doesn\u2019t become a hurdle during the mock call.It is preferred to use a cabin with normal temperature and appropriate gadgets to practice the mock call effectively.\u00a0\u00a0For instance, practicing a mock call on your desk where other colleagu"

            "content": "This May, Salesmate is bringing Formula Fields, that\u2019ll help you create custom formulas and use them for various sales, marketing, or customer service calculations or metrics. You must be familiar with Custom Fields in Salesmate. Consider Formula Fields as a high-level upgrade.Let\u2019s start with the basics.So, what are Formula Fields?Formula Fields are equation-based custom fields where you can combine functions, operators, and existing Salesmate fields, and create a formula of your choice to get answers to complicated calculations.Now, Formula Fields works with the four most essential modules in Salesmate:1. Contacts2. Companies3. Deals4. ActivitiesJust to give a simple example, you want to calculate the discount amount for every deal you create.You can create a simple formula like:Deal Value*25%Now, every time you open up any deal, you\u2019ll find the discount amount calculated automatically.I understand you might need more insight on how this feature can help you in real business scenarios.So, we\u2019ll take three perspectives \u2013 Sales, Marketing, and Customer Service. And see how Formula Fields can help each team.Formula Fields for sales teamsLet\u2019s assume you want to calculate commission for every deal your sales reps close. You can calculate sales commission in multiple ways, and every business has a different approach to it.But for ease of understanding, let\u2019s assume that you want to give 10% of the Deal Value as a commission to the rep.Here\u2019s how you can create a Formula Field for this use case:First, go to \u201cManage Fields\u201d from the New Deal option. Create a \u201cNew Custom Field\u201d and choose the newly added \u201cFormula\u201d option at the very bottom.This is the space where you\u2019ll create a formula from scratch. You\u2019ll find 40+ functions and operators here. You can also use your existing fields as a part of your equation.So, this is the formula we can use to calculate the commission for each deal.Once you make the formula live, you will see the new field active in every deal with the calculation you need.Remember, Formula Fields are dynamic, and they work based on the equations you have set. So, if you change the deal value, you will notice the change in commission as well.Formula Fields for marketing teamsLet\u2019s try to broaden our vision for Formula Fields, and this time we will take an example for marketing agencies.As an agency, you deal with a lot of freelance content creators, and you have to pay them every month based on how many words they have written.We can ditch Excel for this task and automatically calculate the total amount you have to pay using Formula Fields.First, we need to create two custom fields inside the Deal module.1. Number of Words Per Article2. Per Word ChargesNow, we will create a Formula Field, that\u2019ll give me the total cost of each article, and the formula will go something like this:By the end of the month, you can create a detailed report on how many words have been created by the writer and how much the total cost is.This means Formula Fields is an amazing tool to supercharge your reports and performance tracking.We can also take another example for the customer service teams.Formula Fields for customer service teamsLet\u2019s assume, we want to calculate the insurance policy renewal date.First, we need to add a custom formula field of \u201cPolicy Start Date\u201d.Now, we will create a new custom field with a formula. It would look something like this:This formula will automatically calculate the next policy date, so your service team can connect with customers or use automation to shoot reminder emails.There are tons of use cases, and Formula Fields can truly add value to your sales, marketing, and CX efforts.

Once you know who you\u2019re targeting, you can create more personalized and relevant content that will resonate with them.Moreover, you can also create a buyer persona to understand your target audience better. Here\u2019s how you can create a buyer persona \u2013Start by collecting data about your ideal customer. This data can be collected through surveys, interviews, or even just by observing their behavior.Once you have this data, create a profile of your ideal customer. Be sure to include things like their age, gender, income, interests, and so on.\u00a0Finally, give your persona a name and a face, so you can easily imagine your target customer when you\u2019re creating content or making other marketing decisions.\u00a0By following many such effective marketing automation examples, you can easily identify prospective customer segments for your marketing campaigns.2.

These specific purposes or calls-to-action (CTAs) can include the following: download a white paper, sign up for a webinar, drive more traffic to the website, or make a purchase.Email marketing campaigns can be extremely effective in achieving business goals, such as increasing brand awareness, generating leads, or selling products or services. However, email marketing campaigns must be well-planned and well-executed in order to be successful.So, take a look at how you can effectively create and execute an email marketing campaign.How to create and execute an email marketing campaign?When it comes to email subscribers, 60% of consumers prefer to subscribe to a company\u2019s email list for promotional messages. Compared to this, only 20% of them follow brands on social media. This reflects how important email marketing is for businesses that want to scale their revenue and increase their brand presence.Moreover, perfectly executing your email marketing campaign is important because it can have a substantial impact on your overall results. Below are the steps to create and execute an email marketing campaign and ensure that your email campaign is a success.1. Create a relevant email listThe first step is to create and compile an email list consisting of a relevant audience.You can build an email list that includes subscribers who have provided consent to receive marketing emails from you. This includes promotions, updates, announcements, and informative emails that help you stay connected with them in the long term.Your goal with an email list is to nurture leads, convert them into customers, and maintain relationships with existing customers to have successful email campaigns.In fact, 78% of websites make it extremely easy for visitors to sign up on their email list. Use opt-in forms, pop-ups, or a prompt located at the bottom of your webpage to get subscribers for your email marketing campaigns.Other methods involve using lead magnets, such as giveaways and contests, offering discount coupons, and prompting visitors to sign up before they can access your content.2. Define your goalsBefore you start blasting your email list with promotional emails, it is important to know why you are doing it.Set clear marketing goals that you want to achieve with your email marketing strategy. This lets you create a focused strategy for your email campaign.For example, the aim of your email marketing strategy could be to clean up your list and maintain email list hygiene, promote an upcoming sale, announce a new product, or simply get more conversions.With defined goals, you can then decide on the email marketing ideas to implement. You can also set metrics and benchmarks to measure your progress during the campaign and improve your marketing efforts.3. Determine the timeline of your campaignBeing in the right place at the right time can make a lot of difference.Planning the timeline of your email marketing campaign allows you to specify which types of emails to send and when.Create a content calendar and schedule your emails to be sent at fixed durations. Pick a frequency that you think works best.While planning the timeline for your email marketing campaign, make sure to include all the stages, including ideation, planning, execution, and measuring performance. This practice will help you create effective email marketing campaigns.4. Get acquainted with different email typesWhat type of emails do you want to send to your subscribers? How can you turn them into customers?The goals that you want to achieve with your email marketing campaign determine the types of emails you should include in your strategy.Receiving similar emails that talk about the same set of products can get boring, and your subscribers may lose interest, leading to an increase in the number of subscribers.Keep them engaged by including different types of emails in "

This is the prime reason why almost every business invests in it.As per email marketing statistics, around 4.3 billion people use emails to communicate with their customers. Not only this, but email is also a chief way for a brand to distribute its content.Now, you might be making a lot of efforts to market your business and distribute the content. At the end of the day, it doesn\u2019t matter if you are not getting results. And the results are depicted by the key performance metrics (KPIs) of email marketing.There are various email marketing KPIs. And KPIs for each goal is different, whether it is generating leads, boosting subscribers, increasing product purchases, or anything else. Therefore, you need to analyze them selectively based on your business goal.In this article, we will explore all the email marketing KPIs in absolute detail. So, let\u2019s just dive into it!\u00a0Table of contentsWhat are email marketing KPIs?\u00a0Email marketing KPIs & metrics you need to track in 20231. Email open rate\u00a02.

Subscriber lifetime value\u00a0What are email marketing KPIs?\u00a0Email marketing key performance indicators are the metrics that show the performance of different aspects of an email campaign. As mentioned, their analysis may vary based on the business goal.\u00a0Email marketing KPIs help in understanding:\nHow does the person interact with email?\u00a0\nHave they opened it or not?\u00a0\nHow many responded to it?\u00a0And many more! These and many other questions are easily answered with the help of email marketing data of KPIs.\u00a0Email marketing KPIs & metrics you need to track in 2023To effectively run, measure, and manage your email marketing drip campaigns, you need to monitor the following email marketing metrics & KPIs!1. Email open rate\u00a0As its name suggests, an open rate indicates how many people opened your email from the total emails sent. Email open can help you measure the performance of your campaign but is not that effective. According to 99 firms,\u00a096% of people check their email inbox every dayWhy?\u00a0Well, when an email is sent over to the customer, it has a tracking pixel which is an invisible image. If that image is downloaded, the email is recorded as open. However, for online security, image blocking is enabled by many users. So, even if they open the email, it will not be counted as open.On the other hand, Apple has introduced some privacy features in iOS 15, including the Mail Privacy Protection feature. Due to this feature, every email appears to be open, making the open rate an ineffective KPI.Open rate is only valuable if you want to track the performance of two different timelines. For example, if you want to compare the current month with the previous one. However, you need to be extremely careful.2. Email deliverability rate\u00a0The email deliverability rate specifies how many emails were delivered to the user\u2019s inbox. It is assumed that all the emails sent are received by the customers, but it is not always. Sometimes, the email bounces back from the receiving servers.There can be many reasons for that, which can lead to low deliverability. Here are some factors that can lead to a low deliverability rate:\nMaking it tough for users to unsubscribe\u00a0Sending mails from a free-domain email address\u00a0Missing custom authentication while sending the email.\u00a0Ideally, a deliverability rate of 95% is considered the best. The formula to calculate it is:\u00a03. Click-through rate\u00a0An email marketer is most excited about this KPI.\u00a0Click-through rate is defined as a measure of the total number of people who clicked on one or more links in your email.\u00a0Your email can have multiple links; therefore, it is crucial to find out which link enticed the user and where it was placed.\u00a0Once you know this, you can tune your marketing strategy to work in that way. For example, if you have a link on top of the email and it is clicked more, this means that your email is designed well.\u00a0Moreover, in the case of multiple links, analyze their structure and words. These two parameters can highly affect the click-through rate. An average click-through rate is between 2-5%.\u00a04. Conversion rate\u00a0Conversion is one of the key goals behind an email marketing strategy. If we talk about the conversion rate, it is calculated as:\u00a0\u00a0The action here can be anything such as filling out a form, buying a product, downloading an eBook, etc. The number of users who clicked on the link and completed the required action is counted as a conversion.\u00a0\u00a0The conversion rate of email marketing is the highest among all the other digital marketing methods.\u00a05. Unsubscribe rate\u00a0The unsubscribe rate is defined as the number of people who unsubscribe from receiving your email after opening it. It may be beneficial in the l"

            "content": "If you want to grow your business quickly and efficiently, you shouldn\u2019t neglect the revenue possibilities of account expansion.\u00a0For many businesses, their existing customer base forms a highly lucrative and easily-accessed source of new revenue.\u00a0But picking this low-hanging fruit depends upon having something to offer that builds on and enhances the value you are already providing. It also depends on communicating that offer in the most effective way.\u00a0\u00a0That\u2019s where contextual upselling comes in.\u00a0Table of ContentsWhat is contextual upselling?\u00a0Why is upselling important in SaaS?\u00a05 Sinful upselling mistakes\u00a011 Great contextual upselling ways to drive more sales\u00a0What is contextual upselling?\u00a0Upselling is the practice of generating revenue for your business by selling more to your existing customers through upgrades. In a SaaS context, this means moving users up from basic packages towards premium ones.\u00a0\u201cContextual upselling\u201d means introducing the value-add offer to users \u201cin context\u201d. That is, at the point in their activities when they are most receptive because they are displaying an explicit interest in or need for the features of the enhanced package.Though \u201ccross-selling\u201d also encourages customers to spend more money with you, cross-selling is focused on promoting different products to users rather than getting them to invest more in one.\u00a0The below image demonstrates the difference between upselling and cross-selling.\u00a0For reasons we\u2019ll explore in this blog, the best ways to promote upselling and cross-selling are rather different.Why is upselling important in SaaS?\u00a0Let\u2019s just take a step back from contextual upselling for a moment, and explain why all SaaS businesses should prioritize upselling to their existing customers:\u00a0According to Harvard Business Review, it costs between 5 to 25 times more to acquire a new user than it does to retain an existing one\u00a0A study by Marketing Metric has shown that \u2013 across all verticals \u2013 the probability of upselling an existing customer is between 60% and 70%. For new prospects, it\u2019s between 5% and 20%\u00a0Productled has found that it is three times cheaper on average to expand account revenue (through upselling and cross-selling) than to acquire new paying customers\u00a0So, how can it be so effective?\u00a0Because successful upselling targets your customers and offers them more of the value you\u2019re already providing. By now, they already know you and trust you to deliver the best.\u00a0\u00a0The challenge in upselling is always in knowing what to offer, when to offer it, and how to make it as easy as possible for the customer to buy. That\u2019s why context is critical.\u00a05 Sinful upselling mistakes\u00a0Most unsuccessful upselling approaches fail because they don\u2019t take context into account adequately. Here are five classic mistakes to avoid:\u00a01. Pushing too often or pushing too early\u00a0If a customer has dismissed a suggestion to upsell, they\u2019re unlikely to go for it if you simply keep showing it again and again. In fact, you\u2019re more likely to irritate them and risk them churning.\u00a0\u00a0Contextual upselling succeeds when it recognizes, anticipates, and offers to solve a user\u2019s needs.\u00a0When you put an upsell forward, it should make sense in the context of where the user is at, what they use your product for, and what they are doing at that precise moment.\u00a0If a user\u2019s situation hasn\u2019t changed, why would they want to see the offer again?\u00a0Similarly, if your product hasn\u2019t proven its value yet, an upsell offer is likely to be taken badly. You have to earn the trust before the suggestion will be viewed as an offer of help.2. Out of context upsellingAdd \u201cpushing at the wrong time or in the wrong place\u201d to the above.\u00a0\u00a0Why do many cold callers get a touch reception from people who really would benefit from reviewing their life insurance?\u00a0It\u2019s because the person on the other end of the call wasn\u2019t thinking about those topics at the time \u2013 so the message comes as an interruption. It is not \u201cin context\u201d with their present actions, and so, it is often viewed as unwanted pressure.\u00a0\u00a0Imagine seeing this model in Loom, just after you log in.\u00a0What are the chances of you paying attention to it before you manage to use the app to record a video?\u00a0At this point, you\u2019d just ignore the pop-up and carry on with your task in hand. Hence, such out of context upselling doesn\u2019t perform well.\u00a03. Misunderstanding your users\u2019 needs\u00a0Are you upselling the right solution for your users\u2019 needs?\u00a0\u00a0If you try to get them signed up for the upgraded premium version of a feature they haven\u2019t used on the basic package, they\u2019re unlikely to convert.However, if you provide a free trial, they\u2019ll get an insight into the premium version and will be enticed to go with it!\u00a0Contextual upselling depends on knowing what customers are looking to achieve with your product and anticipating their needs with your suggested solutions.4. Being opaque about pricing\u00a0Upselling works as a revenue growth strategy because you\u2019re focusing on people you already have a relationship "

            "content": "Software as a service (SaaS) is when a cloud-based software is hosted by the company and made available online, instead of downloading it offline on your devices.\u00a0\nThe SaaS model pushes ease of access and makes it very convenient to access software services, avoiding the hassle of saving it online.\u00a0\nThe concept seems simple, but more than 15,000 businesses engage in SaaS sales. SaaS is the current leader of the global technology trend, and it has every right to be.\u00a0\nThis article provides you with a comprehensive guide to SaaS success in 2023. However, before we dive into a bunch of effective pointers and tips for SaaS sales success, let\u2019s clear some fundamentals.\nTable of Contents1) What is SaaS sales?2) Factors affecting the length of a SaaS sales cycle 3) Different stages involved in a SaaS sales process  4) Unique challenges encountered while making SaaS sales  5) Useful techniques to boost your SaaS sales6) How to improve SaaS sales 7) Software tools that will come in handy for SaaS sales 8) Important SaaS sales metrics \nWhat is SaaS sales?\nSaaS sales is the process of selling web applications or software to customers. The two core focuses for SaaS salespeople is to acquire new customers and upsell or retain existing customers.\u00a0\nLike all B2B sales, the ultimate goal is to show how your product can make the customer more successful. SaaS products typically have subscription-based pricing, so prospects who convert become repeat customers on a monthly or annual basis.\u00a0\nFactors affecting the length of a SaaS sales cycle\u00a0\nTo create accurate revenue forecasts, it is of the essence to know the length of your sales cycle. This is important for the health of any SaaS company. The length of your sales cycle will depend on the following factors.\u00a0\n1. Type of customer\u00a0\nSmall businesses and solo entrepreneurs usually require less time to buy, given that the number of people involved in the decision-making process is less. \nBut in the case of enterprise customers, things are a little different. They carefully vet and approve the purchase and have a lot of decision-makers involved in the process.\u00a0\n2. Price of product\u00a0\u00a0\nAs the price of a product increases, the sales cycle will also increase. Here is a benchmark of sales cycles offered by SaaStr founder and Adobe EchoSign co-founder Jason Lemkin.\u00a0\u00a0\nPrice of product\u00a0\u00a0Estimated length of the sales cycle in days\u00a0< $2,000\u00a0Within 14 days\u00a0\u00a0< $5,000\u00a0Within 30 days\u00a0< $25,000\u00a0Within 90 days\u00a0\u00a0< $100,000\u00a0Within 90 to 180 days\u00a0\nSource\u00a0\nThe increase in product price entails more decision-makers, budget planning, demos, etc. Hence, it is no surprise that products with a higher price point will follow a longer sales cycle.\n3. Complexity of product\u00a0\nAs customization options for your product increase, the number of demos or support required to convince your lead to buy the product will also go up. Therefore, as the complexity of the product increases, the sales cycle lengthens.\n\nSource\u00a0\nDifferent stages involved in a SaaS sales process\u00a0\u00a0\nThe stages involved in the SaaS sales process are as follows.\u00a0\n\nProspecting \u2013 put your name out there with online ads, blog posts, whitepapers, and other forms of inbound marketing.\u00a0\n\n\nQualifying \u2013 Obviously, not all your visitors will turn to customers. Hence, it is essential that lead scoring is done to qualify prospects.\u00a0\n\n\nPresenting \u2013 Get the qualified prospects in a one-on-one interaction, address their pain points and suggest how you can solve them.\n\n\nHandling objections \u2013 Make your users realize the value of your product. That is the only way to handle objections. If they ask if a certain feature is missing, it suggests a gap in their minds. Your job is to convince them that the only way to fill that gap is via your product.\n\n\nClosing \u2013 closing is when a sales rep brings in a customer.\u00a0\n\n\nNurturing \u2013 Nurturing entails all your company\u2019s practices to retain the customer. \n\n\nSource\u00a0\nUnique challenges encountered while making SaaS sales\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you come from a non-SaaS selling role, fitting into a SaaS sales rep role can be difficult. The job can pose certain challenges, and they include:\u00a0\u00a0\n1. Competition\u00a0\nWith more than 15,000 businesses dealing in SaaS sales, you have to make peace with the fact that there is abundant competition in the market. \nYou need to know how to set yourself and your company apart. Understand where you are stronger than them, and once you are clear about that you can hatch plans to win against them.\u00a0\n2. Understanding the technology your customers already use\u00a0\nYour product might be top-notch, but you have to keep in mind that customers have to integrate it with their technology stack. And this is where change management comes into play. \nWith a solid change management process, organizations can handle numerous modifications including new technology implementation and other miscellaneous adjustments.\u00a0 \nTherefore, the quality of the product really won\u2019t matter if your SaaS service is not the right fit for your customer\u2019s software"

Countdown timers\u00a0They work wonders for creating a sense of excitement for an upcoming event, an end of the sale or the beginning of one, or even notify about subscription expiration.Here\u2019s an example to help you understand this better.You are going to announce a Cyber Monday sale on your website.\u00a0\u00a0You create a newsletter with all the necessary details, like discount rate, product range, and add a countdown timer to create some excitement and urgency.\u00a0This will entice your subscribers to stay in touch with the updates, which in turn increases participation on the main day.\u00a0The results bring you better sales and more click-throughs.Here\u2019s how you can embed a countdown timer on your emails.Choose a tool like Sendtric to create customized HTML code with a live or static countdown for your email.Choose a date and time.Customize the design.\u00a0Copy that code onto your sales email template.It might look like a lot of work, but once you see the results, you\u2019ll know why this is such an exciting upgrade to regular emails to make it interactive.2.

            "content": "If you want to grow your business and profit margins, understanding customer needs is the key.\u00a0This means identifying your customer\u2019s pain points and finding ways to deliver the best possible customer experiences.\u00a0If you take care of your existing customers, bringing in new customers becomes a whole lot easier.\u00a0This is why it is no surprise that focusing on improving customer experience results in up to 80% of an increase in revenue for businesses.\u00a0Keeping that in mind, let us talk about some ways you can focus on your customers\u2019 needs better.\u00a01. VOC surveys\u00a0Voice of Customer (VOC) surveys are a great way to give your customers the voice they need to tell you exactly where you can improve. This can be through whatever medium suits your business and your customers \u2013 surveys, interviews, etc.\u00a0Having that data in your hands can be invaluable. It is the future of your business \u2013 the route your products and services need to take if they want to truly succeed in the competitive market.\u00a0A good way to survey your ideal audience would be to use a service such as Survey Monkey or SurveyAnyPlace to reach them.\u00a0\u00a0These tools help you conduct market research by getting you in touch with the right people to take your survey. These people will be your ideal customers based on demographics like gender, income group, age, etc.\u00a0\u00a0However, VOC surveys aren\u2019t a guaranteed fix for identifying and meeting customer needs.\u00a0\u00a0To be effective, you need to ask the right questions. That means:\u00a0Keeping questions simple and to-the-point\u00a0The easier it is for customers to answer your questions, the more likely they are to fill in your survey, and the more feedback you\u2019ll receive.\u00a0Steering clear of leading questions\u00a0\u201cWhat do you think of our excellent customer support team?\u201d That\u2019s a leading question because the word \u201cexcellent\u201d can produce a biased response.Keep your questions neutral\u00a0A better version of that question would be: \u201cRate our customer support team from 0-5.\u201d\u00a0Asking a mix of close and open-ended questions\u00a0Close-ended questions (e.g. \u201cDo you like our new product?\u201d can be answered in a single word, or by making a multiple-choice selection. \u00a0They\u2019re useful for quickly analyzing specific pain points. Open-ended questions. E.g. \u201cWhat do you like about our new product?\u201d requires a longer, more nuanced response that provides more detailed, subjective feedback.\u00a0\u00a0Both play a key part in meeting the needs of your customers.\u00a02. Keeping in constant contact with your customers\u00a0Selling your product or service does not mark the end of your relationship but rather the beginning.\u00a0\u00a0You can contact customers following up on their purchase, asking them to rate your service, or letting them know when you have a discount going on.\u00a0Follow-up review request messages should be a standard part of your email marketing process.\u00a0\u00a0Once a customer has been using your product or service for a set amount of time, ask for feedback, just like pet products retailer Chewy does in this email:\u00a0Image SourceThis is a great example of a product review email because it:\u00a0\nClearly explains what action the customer should take next\u00a0Makes it easy for the customer to review each product in turn by including individual calls to action\u00a0Reminds the customer of the specific products they purchased\u00a0There are multiple benefits to consistently communicating with customers in this way.\u00a0\u00a0Firstly, it demonstrates that you care about their experience and genuinely want them to enjoy your product, which can encourage loyalty.\u00a0Secondly, it helps you identify areas in which their needs aren\u2019t being met (or could be improved upon).\u00a0And thirdly, 93% of consumers read reviews before making a purchase \u2013\u2013 so the more (positive) reviews you have, the better. Particularly as 73% of buyers only pay attention to reviews written in the last month.\u00a0Asking for reviews not only shows customers that their opinion matters, but you can also use those reviews on your website to show potential customers how much your brand is trusted.\u00a0\u00a0Business Insurance USA does this on their site by syndicating their Google reviews to show up on their page:\u00a0AMZ Pathfinder does something similar on their website as well:\u00a0In both of these cases, the companies succeed at showing website visitors how they can help them grow their brand.\u00a03. Actions speak louder than words\u00a0Surveys are an extremely valuable tool in helping you identify and meet customer needs. But it\u2019s worth noting that actions often speak louder than words.\u00a0One issue with surveys is that not all of your customers are going to complete them. That means the results are naturally skewed toward the type of people who are prepared to spend their time filling in surveys.\u00a0\u00a0Even if you offer a huge incentive for taking part, you might not get a truly representative sample of your customer base.\u00a0Another potential problem is that customers might tell you one thing when they really think another.

When you\u2019re on the path of growth, you need to capture and nurture every prospect. \nAnd the key to accomplishing that is effective communication, which you can achieve only when you have access to the best CRM for insurance agents which can simplify the way of managing your work process.\nInsurance agents and brokers deal with multiple tasks and clients every day. From calling prospects to closing deals and scheduling appointments, they\u2019ve got a lot on the platter. \nTherefore, without a streamlined process of managing tasks, an agent might miss out on essential tasks. To prevent such errors, you need insurance CRM software that is intuitive and adds value to your company.\nFirst, let\u2019s look at what insurance CRM is and the challenges insurance agents face to understand CRM\u2019s needs in business.\nTable of contentsWhat is insurance CRMChallenges an insurance agent faces regularlyHow can a CRM system help businesses to improve ROI?Benefits of CRM for the insurance sectorChoose the right insurance CRM that meets all the needs6 Best insurance CRM software in 2023How Salesmate CRM can enhance the workflow of insurance agents?Some additional features of Salesmate that can help boost your salesFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat is insurance CRM?\nInsurance CRM is an essential tool that helps you build lasting relationships and increase customer retention. It automates all those menial tasks for you like lead capturing, workflow management, activity tracking, you name it, and it\u2019ll take care of it.\nInsurance CRM software is designed specifically for companies and insurance agents. It facilitates them in working effectively to convert more prospects into customers. In these times, an automated data process is pivotal to meeting a multitude of requests and inquiries. So, this is where you need a CRM to stand out from the masses.\nChallenges an insurance agent faces regularly\nAs we mentioned earlier, it\u2019s a competitive market, and insurance agents tackle a myriad of issues when they\u2019re working with clients.\nOn a daily basis, an insurance agent faces high competition, fragmented data issues, inefficient workflows, extremely tough lead generation, and many more problems.\n\n So, here we have shed light on all the challenges that agents and brokers from the insurance sector face.\u00a0\n1. There\u2019s close competition\nHas it ever happened that you got an inquiry from a client just a day back, and they\u2019ve already moved on to the competitor?\nWell, for you, it must be just a day, but this generation Z is quicker than you think; a slight delay in revert and consider them gone!\nThe insurance sector especially faces cut-throat competition when it comes to gaining more clients. And it\u2019s not the fault of an insurance agent as well; they\u2019re already going the extra mile when it comes to completing tasks. \nThis is where automation comes in; let the software handle manual tasks so the insurance agent can go ahead and work to his full potential.\n2. Your sales process is fragmented\nYes, spreadsheets and excels are good sources of storing data. However, you must\u2019ve experienced fragmented data and information, which affected the client relationships as well.\u00a0\nWhen you\u2019ve got a lot of information on your plate and don\u2019t have a streamlined way of processing it, errors are bound to happen. While this manual practice is followed by many, it does more harm than good in the long run business.\u00a0\n3. Inefficient workflow is hampering the revenue\nThe major drawback of every insurance agency is inefficiency in the workflow. Manual handling of sequential tasks can take up too much of your time, resulting in low productivity and scattered workflow.\u00a0\nFrom processing policies, renewals, and taking follow-ups, all while keeping the communication with clients intact, the workflow becomes relatively inefficient and leads to a decline in revenue. \nOne can\u2019t expect repeat business when the workflow itself isn\u2019t up to the mark. Companies need to level up and combat these challenges; as such, decreased productivity will lead them nowhere.\u00a0\nManual follow-ups stop from this moment!Introducing your next insurance CRM.Try FREE for 15 days\n4.

The second tip would be to hire candidates who fit in your culture as it will make the work environment an enjoyable place to work.Finally, being a founder can be lonely so I would recommend entrepreneurs meet and establish friendships with other entrepreneurs who have been through similar struggles and can therefore help them overcome them.\u00a0Ha Anh \u2013 Luu\u00a0Marketing Manager, Bloock\u00a0Do not get discouraged by the external adversities, even if it is a big pandemic like the one we had to deal with.

I have added a section in this article to clear things up.\u00a03.\u00a0Acts as a guiding force\u00a0Sales quota\u00a0ensures that the sales team remains on the right path when they\u2019re working towards achieving their goals.\u00a0For instance, if you have five different product lines, you can create quotas based on which product is more in trend, which product you need to sell more this quarter, and strategies to achieve the same.\u00a0This way, your team will know which product to prioritize and achieve their\u00a0sales quota\u00a0seamlessly!What are the types of\u00a0sales quotas?\u00a0Sales quotas are determined based on the company\u2019s size, its revenue, and the number of products that the company sells. So, different companies need to implement different\u00a0sales quotas for their sales reps.\u00a0Let\u2019s find out what are the different types of\u00a0sales quotas to determine which one will work best for your company.\u00a01.\u00a0Profit quota\u00a0The primary focus of the profit quota is on the gross profit of the sale, not total revenue.\u00a0\u00a0You can find gross profit by subtracting the cost of goods and\u00a0acquisition cost\u00a0from total revenue. This method motivates the reps to focus on the profit generated from each product sold, not the total revenue.\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, your sales reps will be inclined to close more high-value clients to reach their\u00a0sales quota\u00a0faster.\u00a02.\u00a0Volume-based\u00a0sales quota\u00a0A volume-based\u00a0sales quota\u00a0takes the number of units sold or total revenue into consideration. A majority of small businesses adopt volume-based\u00a0sales quotas as the initial goal for every company is to sell more products.\u00a0\u00a0The success of this\u00a0sales quota\u00a0is measured\u00a0by whether the sales rep is able to sell x number of units in a given time period or not.\u00a03.\u00a0Activity quota\u00a0An activity quota is mainly for SDRs or BDRs, wherein they need to accomplish a certain set of activities within a given time period.\u00a0The success of activity quotas is measured based on whether or not your rep is able to complete the assigned tasks or not. Activity quotas can be calling x number of leads per week, sending emails, conducting training sessions, etc.\u00a04.\u00a0Forecast quota\u00a0As the title gives it away, forecast quotas are created based on historical data and performance. Such quotas can be assigned to various territories based on their revenue or teams.\u00a0For example, Ryan sold products worth $10,000 in the last quarter. So, based on the revenue and your rep\u2019s potential, you decide to increase his quota by 20%. So, his goal for the next quarter will be"

            "content": "The main image of your brand is what customers experience. When the customers are satisfied with your products or services, they\u2019re more likely to become an advocate for your brand.\u00a0So, how do you enhance customer experience? Well, many businesses believe that customer service = customer experience. But, as always, I like to challenge such myths!\u00a0And I was able to debunk them with the help of 10 experts. So, let\u2019s take a look at what they have to say on this myth, and whether they\u2019re in support of it or against it.\u00a01. Jim SullivanCEO and Founder of\u00a0JCSI\u00a0I strongly believe that customer service does not equal customer experience. This is because customer service is only one part of the overall experience that a customer has.\u00a0Customer experience is made up of the service, resources, products, and promotions a company offers its clientele. When all of these factors are great, it equals a great customer experience. Customer service obviously impacts this, as it can be positive or negative, but if this one thing is negative and all other components of an experience are positive, the overall experience would still be satisfactory.\u00a02. Ryan CartwrightHead of sales,\u00a0Spacelift\u00a0The terms \u201ccustomer service\u201d and \u201ccustomer experience\u201d are often confused or used synonymously. They\u2019re not the same thing, even though they\u2019re related.Customer service focuses on human interaction and customer support, while customer experience encompasses the customer\u2019s whole journey with the business from start to finish. Customer experience includes customer service, the product/service itself, marketing and design, and the feelings the customer has for the company.\u00a0\u00a0To think that customer service is the same as CX is diminishing the entire customer journey it takes to be aware and loyal to the brand.\u00a03. Matt MillerCEO and Founder of\u00a0Embroker\u00a0In a sense, it is true. But there are some important factors you have to consider.\u00a0\u00a0Customer service is only one part of the customer experience! You also have to think about how satisfied customers are with your products and services in general (including what they like and dislike). If customers feel that you don\u2019t pay attention to their needs, then they won\u2019t be happy \u2013 no matter how good your customer service is.\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s also important to note that bad customer service can actually ruin the customer experience, even if your products and services are good.\u00a0So,\u00a0it\u2019s essential to make sure that your customer service is up to par!\u00a04. Karen MangiaBest selling\u00a0author and VP of Customer and Market Insights\u00a0at SalesforceCustomer support asks \u201cHow do we\u00a0fix what\u2019s\u00a0broken now?\u201d Customer Experience\u00a0asks \u201cWhere do we have the potential to\u00a0go together?\u201d\u00a0While customer support remains a\u00a0critical function\u00a0\u2013 because even the best products and processes break down \u2013 fixing\u00a0what\u2019s broken\u00a0isn\u2019t enough to develop and sustain loyal customers over the long term.\u00a0Customer Experience is the\u00a0overall impression\u00a0you leave with your customers.\u00a0Customer Experience is the very definition of your brand, your\u00a0brand\u2019s value, and your\u00a0and\u00a0customer support is just one of many.\u00a05. Justin NabityCEO of\u00a0Physicians Thrive\u00a0think customer experience is not equal to customer service. Customer service is only the interaction a customer has with the business\u2019s service provider in order to get assistance regarding their product or service.\u00a0Customer experience includes the whole customer journey, like all the interactions the customer has with your business. This includes the marketing of the product the customer sees, the sales experience, the interaction customer has during the customer service with your team, and then the post-experience when the customer buys your product.\u00a06. Sam Shepler\u00a0CEO of\u00a0TestimonialHero\u00a0Customer service being the same thing as customer experience is a false statement, but unfortunately, it\u2019s something that many people and businesses believe is true. Simply put, customer service is a piece of the puzzle while customer experience is the puzzle as a whole; yes, they\u2019re related, and yes, you cannot have one without the other one, but they\u2019re definitely not the same thing as customer service is one vital but singular aspect of the many that form customer experience.\u00a07. Ninh Tran\u00a0CEO and Co-Founder,\u00a0Snapbrillia\u00a0\u00a0This is a myth. Customer experience and customer service are mutually exclusive entities. Customer service is just one part of the entire customer journey, while customer experience encompasses all the interactions between your brand and a customer. While having both is ideal, companies can offer great customer service but be lacking in the customer experience aspect and vice versa.\u00a08. Jeff Mains\u00a0\u00a0CEO of Champion Leadership Group\u00a0\u00a0Organizations are increasingly attempting to mitigate consumer pain points in order to avoid such reputational concerns.

And these new ways have brought new bottlenecks in the sales processes.\u00a0According to a\u00a0survey by Silent Edge, 49% of sales directors felt that\u00a0it\u2019s taking too much time to close deals. 22% of them reported lost\u00a0sales pipeline\u00a0as their biggest challenge.\u00a0The pressure of bringing in more revenue is immense. Sadly, all the burdens are shouldered by the sales managers.\u00a0We can\u2019t let that happen, can we?So, what\u2019s the solution?What are sales KPIs?\u00a0Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are a type of performance measurement, which evaluates the success of an organization and helps make smart and informed decisions about the direction the business should take.\u00a0The key is to choose the right KPIs that are most relevant to your industry and business goals. Choosing the wrong KPIs is equally damaging in nature.First, let\u2019s understand the WHY of it, then we can move forward with the HOW.Why\u00a0are\u00a0sales KPIs important to measure?\u00a0What\u2019s the point of all the data in your system if you can\u2019t track the performance of your sales.\u00a0This is where KPI for sales comes into\u00a0the picture.\u00a0With the help of sales KPIs, you can\u00a0come\u00a0up with new strategies and approaches. Tracking these KPIs can also help you forecast your future sales and revenue generation.\u00a0Sales KPIs as activities\u00a0What we\u2019ve learned over the years is\u00a0\u2013\u00a0the best performing organizations are the ones that are able to break their sales process into individual, measurable activities.\u00a0Most of the B2B sales happen because of certain predictable activities\u00a0\u2013 and negligence of these activities can lead to a decline in sales. Therefore, to keep track of your KPIs, it\u2019s also recommended to use real-time data visualization software so that you can be sure that you can always stay on top of your key metrics.Here are some activity-based sales KPI examples that\u00a0you\u00a0can look into\u00a0for your sales team:\u00a0\nNo.\u00a0of sales meetings with new prospects/existing customers\u00a0Calling\u00a0X\u00a0no.\u00a0of potential customers\u00a0Conducting\u00a0X\u00a0no.\u00a0of product presentations\u00a0Sending emails\u00a0X\u00a0no.\u00a0of existing customers\u00a0Sending out\u00a0X\u00a0no.\u00a0of written offers\u00a0Conducting\u00a0X\u00a0no.\u00a0of follow up calls\u00a0Here are some benefits of setting individual goals for your organization and tracking them:\u00a01.\u00a0Improved sales management\u00a0Understanding the relationship between your activities and your sales results can become a much stronger tool for managing your sales organization, conducting sales reviews, forecasting sales, and prioritizing future activities.\u00a0In short, it leads to better sales.\u00a02.\u00a0Practical sales tools\u00a0Your sales representatives get better sales tools\u00a0to work with.

Or go for\u00a0the one that you\u2019re familiar with due to various advertisements on different channels?\u00a0I am guessing that majority of people would avoid taking a risk to purchase a product that they haven\u2019t seen\u00a0advertised\u00a0or marketed.\u00a0So, where does this myth, \u201cA great product will sell itself,\u201d arise from?\u00a0Well, you hear many statements in\u00a0the\u00a0marketing and sales industry, and some leave a strong impact on your decision when more and more people start believing it.\u00a0So, to put an end to such myths, I reached out to experts and asked for their opinion on this most common myth. Let\u2019s find out what they have to say!\u00a01. Mandi GrazianoAuthor,\u00a0Mandi Graziano\u00a0\u201cGood service sells itself. It takes good people to activate good service for a good product for it to sell. People come back again and again to a product that makes them feel good about buying it and experiencing it. A product is nothing without the service and people support behind it.\u201d\u00a02. Andrea WaltzCo-author of Go For No!This is a classic myth. Great products, marketed well, will get attention. But they don\u2019t automatically sell themselves. If they did, no one would hire a salesforce because everyone believes they\u2019ve created a great product! However, it\u2019s not just about sharing features and benefits anymore. It\u2019s about helping customers make the right decision and having the courage to ask people to buy when it is.3. Drewbie\u00a0WilsonVP Sales,\u00a0Break Free Academy\u00a0The truth is\u2026 marketing will make or break a product. You can have the best product in the world but if nobody knows about it, how will it sell? However, when you recognize that marketing can help sell millions of dollars of \u201cpet rocks\u201d because it tugged on people\u2019s emotions, you will understand the way society really works. People purchase on emotion, and if nobody knows about the product and how great it is, they\u00a0won\u2019t\u00a0have any reason to purchase.\u00a04. Maya RotenbergVP of marketing,\u00a0Stoke Talent\u00a0The myth \u201cA great product will sell itself\u201d is untrue.\u00a0It\u2019s the features that people can see working and that they want or need that sell. It is also about how you present these to your market. If a company is simply trying to tell us how great their product is without something to back it up, we will quickly lose interest.\u00a0You need to present the product,\u00a0or service features fair and square and demonstrate them clearly to potential users.\u00a05. Jacob EngelsCo-founder & VP of sales,\u00a0Paperless\u00a0I strongly believed in this before understanding how much a good (consultative, value-driven, customer-obsessed, and listening) revenue a team can change. Some companies have the weakest product and still manage to be the category queen in their space \u2013 whereas there are great products in the market that are having massive issues gaining market share. From my experience, it really comes down to how you position the company and how well you understand your client\u2019s needs. Listening to the pain points and then delivering value and showing how to solve them will ultimately sell a product.\u00a06. Amit RajCEO of\u00a0The Links Guy\u00a0A huge selling myth is that if you have a great product or service, customers are going to buy it. Although such novel ideas do come about occasionally, they are rare and businesses still need to reach buyers.\u00a0\u00a0Most businesses these days work in tough competitive conditions with many products or services fulfilling similar demands.\u00a0Therefore,\u00a0the real distinction is how well customer orientation is understood and executed by the company. There are many examples of failing business ideas simply because the purpose of the product or service wasn\u2019t defined well enough, consumer orientation is critical to\u00a0sales success.\u00a07. Calloway CookPresident of\u00a0Illuminate Labs\u00a0There is so much market saturation today with startup costs being low. This means that retailers and potential clients are bombarded with product pitches. Even the best products will require an expert salesperson to convince a customer or partner to buy.\u00a0Anyone who believes that a great product sells itself is mistaken. A great product can sell itself once its market position has been thoroughly established, but no products sell themselves right out of the gate without marketing and sales effort.ConclusionFrom the above responses, it\u2019s clear that it takes more than a good product when you want to sell it. You need to execute certain marketing strategies and campaigns and reach a potential audience.You can only sell your product when the audience knows what it does and how it can help them.

Why? The availability of big data on this scale was not possible in the past.\u00a0\u00a0First, storage and access to data are challenging. Most big companies use magnetic storage to store data, which is prone to damage and is expensive.\u00a0\u00a0But with the rise of software as a\u00a0service (SaaS) applications\u00a0that usually use the cloud for storage, everything changed.\u00a0\u00a0Data storage and access have become easier and economical.

If you are not using data in your sales process, you are fighting an already uphill battle unequipped.What is data-driven sales?Data-driven sales is sales outputs from a data-driven strategy that leverages the collected information in every customer interaction.\u00a0\u00a0With data-driven sales strategies, your company is better equipped to customize brand and sales messaging, predict and anticipate potential customer needs, and consistently win new customers.\u00a0\u00a0The adage about working smarter and not harder applies here. With data, you can intelligently focus your efforts on things that matter instead of blindly selling to anyone willing to hear you.\u00a0\u00a0For example, you can analyze where most of your callers are coming from by using data from your\u00a0communications solutions.\u00a0\u00a0With this information, you can get insights into where your business is getting good engagement with your potential and existing customers vs. the locations where you have no presence.\u00a0\u00a0From there, you can cross-reference that data to other sources to get a bigger picture about your over-the-phone customer transactions.\u00a0\u00a0With the right information, you can customize your sales approach based on the goals of your business.\u00a0\u00a0What is the role of data in driving sales?\u00a0The example above is a simple application of how data can improve your sales strategy. However, the role of data is bigger than that.It is no coincidence that around 49 percent of companies are now using data analytics, according to\u00a0State of BI & Analytics Report 2020, a\u00a0Special COVID-19 Edition by\u00a0SiSense.Small businesses, 50 percent of them in particular, are using data in sales.

It is essential because it does more than help you develop solid, data-driven sales strategies, and strategies to retain existing customers.\u00a0\u00a0This also helps your business reduce customer churn by identifying signs of discontent and dissatisfaction even before the customer makes a complaint. It allows your organization to take action before it leads to a cancellation.\u00a0\u00a03. Price your products right\u00a0Determining the right selling price can be the difference between success and failure for a business. It isn\u2019t simply about setting a price lower than your competitors. Doing that can result in getting the wrong message about your product.\u00a0\u00a0Imagine thinking customers will see your product as affordable but instead be seen as cheap and unreliable. That is why it\u2019s crucial to determine a suitable price that will set your place in the market.\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s where data comes in. It\u2019s not just about how to sell but everything that comes with selling, including pricing. Using data from interactions with customers, you can narrow"

Identify your buyer persona\u00a0There are instances where the lead backs off at the end of the sales process, and your deal falls through the cracks. This is because you didn\u2019t target the right audience.\u00a0Therefore, if you want to close every deal in your sales process, you first need to identify your buyer persona. Find out your target audience, their interests, and preferences, the channels where you can find them, and then\u00a0make your next move,\u00a0Identifying the buyer persona enables you to filter your leads and go ahead with the ones that can be potentially converted into customers.\u00a02. Find out the decision-maker\u00a0Your deal will only go through if you are connected with the right person from the organization.\u00a0For instance, you are offering live chat software,\u00a0you will need to connect with the upper management and present your value\u00a0proposition so that they can consider implementing it into the organization.\u00a0\u00a0At the same time, if you had reached out to a marketing manager of the same company, you wouldn\u2019t have received the same response.\u00a0Take customer experience to the next level!Find out what Salesmate Messenger can do.Try Salesmate NOW!3.

They try to understand how your product/service can be beneficial to them.\u00a0So, in a way, every prospect can seem like a\u00a0tire-kicker\u00a0at the beginning of the sales process.\u00a0In many instances, you may think you are dealing with a potential customer when in actuality, they are just some troublesome\u00a0tire-kickers who prolong your sales process unnecessarily.\u00a0Here\u2019s why\u00a0tire-kickers are bad for your sales:\u00a0They waste your time while taking advantage of your professional knowledge\u00a0Throw off your sales metrics\u00a0Hinder you from investing your time in more important and profitable tasks and prospects\u00a0Working with every lead that walks into your pipeline can seem to be a good way to increase your sales, however, dealing with\u00a0tire-kickers will drain your energy while preventing you from making any profit.\u00a0Hence,\u00a0quality over quantity.\u00a0According to data says that more than\u00a050% of your initial prospects\u00a0will be a bad fit for what you sell.\u00a0The study suggests that 71.4% of the sales reps think that less than half of their prospects are good leads.\u00a0Make the best out of every deal!Try Salesmate Deal Management.Start My Trial NowThis insight suggests that you don\u2019t have to try and close every prospect in front of you, because more than half of the time, it\u2019s going to be a bad lead.\u00a0So, it\u2019s important to adopt a \u2018no\u00a0tire-kickers\u2019 policy by spotting them and marking them beforehand, so that you don\u2019t waste your time over a lost cause.\u00a0Let\u2019s see how you can identify these trouble-makers in your sales pipeline.\u00a0How to identify\u00a0tire-kickers?\u00a0Ever been to a shopping mall and came back empty-handed?\u00a0Don\u2019t kid yourself, you know we\u2019ve all been there.\u00a0We all enjoy window-shopping every once in a while.\u00a0This way, we have all been\u00a0tire-kickers at some point in our lives.

Service that you are selling, but also about your personal life. These\u00a0tire-kickers are typical gossipers.\u00a0Although, sharing a thing or two about your personal life can sometimes help you nurture a good relationship with your clients, but\u00a0tire-kickers will have opinions on everything and they\u2019d use it to elongate the conversation- leading nowhere.\u00a0In addition to being the time wasters,\u00a0tire-kickers often display the following characteristics:\u00a01.

They\u2019re independent, and enjoy moving from one deal to another in sales pipeline, as they are motivated to continue ahead and find new leads.\u00a0To hunters, numbers are everything.\u00a0Hunters are committed, motivated, and determined. Since hunters are highly optimistic, they tend to reach out to every prospect with determination and are able to manage multiple leads in quick succession.\u00a0Hunters are mainly risk-takers and are good at quickly building rapport with prospects, but not necessarily good at cultivating long-term relationships. They attend a lot of networking events, actively surf LinkedIn\u00a0(and other social media), and ask for a lot of referrals.\u00a0This personality thrives in the roles where they get to be independent.\u00a0Who are farmers in sales?\u00a0A farmer salesperson is most comfortable in nurturing existing relationships.

I know what you\u2019re wondering, who else could\u00a0be\u00a0possibly\u00a0eligible for getting sales commission?\u00a0Well, sales commissions are bifurcated into three categories \u2013 individual commission, team commission, and mixed commission.\u00a0\u00a01. Individual commission\u00a0The individual commission plan is targeted towards salespeople who have exceeded their sales quotas. As a result, they are paid a commission based on the sales they made. This\u00a0is only applicable to the salesperson that is involved in making sales.\u00a0Usually, in such situations, a salesperson is also given monthly or weekly targets, which helps their employer determine their commission.\u00a02. Team commission\u00a0You can provide team commission when a target is assigned to the entire team. Thereafter, when your sales team achieves or exceeds their target, the commission is given which can be split among the team members.\u00a0\u00a0The distribution of the commission is based on the percentage determined by the company.\u00a03. Mixed commission\u00a0In an effort to encourage the employees to perform better, many companies offer a commission on an individual basis and to the teams as well. The allocation of the mixed commission is based on the\u00a0effort required on each project.\u00a0So, these are the main three types of sales commissions given to employees.

If you\u2019re on the fence about providing\u00a0sales\u00a0commission\u00a0to your reps, these points will change your mind!\u00a01. Motivation for sales reps\u00a0Motivation is a driving factor for the success of any task. Likewise, if you want your reps to crush their quota in sales, then you need to provide rewards in form of commission.\u00a0Whenever reps get an extra monetary benefit, they will be encouraged to perform\u00a0even\u00a0better.\u00a0So, if you want to retain your best-performing sales reps, providing them\u00a0sales commission\u00a0is highly effective.\u00a02. Boosting productivity\u00a0Let\u2019s say that a sales rep is working with a fixed salary.\u00a0\u00a0At the end of the day, they got another task on a priority basis. Do you think they\u2019ll stay late and finish it? Probably not.\u00a0\u00a0But, in the same scenario, what if the sales rep is getting a commission on every deal made?

So, make sure to check out their take on this common live chat myth.\u00a0Does live chat alienate customers? Let\u2019s hear from the experts!1. Andre\u00a0KazimierskyCEO,\u00a0Improovy\u00a0Whether or not live chat alienates customers depends on how it is executed. If the customer has to go through 10 minutes of communicating with a bot before waiting to chat with a person, they will likely feel alienated. Conversely, if they click a live chat\u00a0box and are immediately connected to customer service, live chat can be a valuable tool for a company.2. Henson TsaiFounder,\u00a0SleekFlow\u00a0I\u00a0Don\u2019t think Live Chat alienates customers.\u00a0Rather, it depends on how your Live Chat route is set and whether you have a system behind it to support smooth and no delayed customer service. Many of our eCommerce clients have installed a Live Chat widget.\u00a0Some of them called it a virtual shop manager as it can cater to customers\u2019 inquiries right away. With a CRM system integrated with the website Live Chat widget, the inquiry can be routed to your\u00a0back-office\u00a0CS team. During non-office hours, auto-reply can be triggered to answer FAQs. Live chat can be helpful in that sense.\u00a03. Jose Herrera\u00a0CEO,\u00a0Horatio\u00a0Live chat is a helpful tool we use in the Customer Experience field every single day.\u00a0While the agents are there to answer questions via phone and email, we find implementing live chats is an excellent way to provide customers with quick answers to questions. The myth that this technology alienates customers couldn\u2019t be farther from the truth.\u00a0In fact, customer engagement can be\u00a0strengthened\u00a0through this feature \u2013 so\u00a0long as the live chat\u00a0reflects the brand\u2019s voice.\u00a0Using language that embodies the brand is key, in addition to making sure each customer feels the live chat is\u00a0personalized, approachable and also friendly.\u00a04. Tyler MartinFounder & Business coach, ThinkTylerChat is not for my industry.However, customer issues are started online in the hopes of finding a solution without the requirement for escalation to an agent.\u00a067% of customers across all industries utilize web self-service to obtain solutions to their questions. Chat has fully embraced retail, travel, and telecom, and the playing field is leveling for other businesses catching up, as chat is faster, more secure, mobile, and in demand.5. Stephen CurryOwner,\u00a0Cocosign\u00a0Despite the high success of Live chats, myths are still surrounding it.\u00a0One of the biggest myths is that live chat takes a lot of time. It means, on average, it usually takes 23 seconds for a live chat agent to answer the initial conversation, and they have only 42 seconds to solve this issue.\u00a0This is just a myth and nothing to be worried about. Customer care executives provide healthy solutions to their customers through live chat, and they resolve every question you have.\u00a06. Bernie\u00a0WongFounder,\u00a0Social Stand\u00a0Live chat is winning the customer support race. They generate the highest customer satisfaction level at\u00a073%\u00a0compared to emails and phone calls. Customers don\u2019t get stuck on hold for hours. They can multitask while waiting for\u00a0a resolution\u00a0to their queries.\u00a0Live chat can also boost conversion rates. Chatters are 2.8 times more to buy high-price and new products after\u00a0engaging with\u00a0a live agent. It is vital to answer their questions in real-time\u00a0during the\u00a0buying experience. As such, live chat boost conversion rates by 20%.\u00a0\u00a07. Brian\u00a0DordevicDirector of strategic planning,\u00a0Alpha Efficiency\u00a0I don\u2019t believe live chat alienates customers.\u00a0In fact, Customer engagement is increased by using live chat. When you make live chat available to your customers, you\u2019ll almost certainly witness increased engagements.\u00a0While part of that growth will come from customers who move to chat instead of email or phone support, some of it will come from individuals who discovered chat and realized they could seek assistance instead of giving up and perhaps abandoning your product.\u00a0Increased customer involvement provides an opportunity to establish a positive first impression and offer customers a cause to return.Final thoughts\u00a0From the responses that we\u2019ve received from industry experts, it\u2019s clear that this myth \u201c"

            "content": "Have you been cold calling your prospects and reaching nowhere?\u00a0Well, let\u2019s put yourself in the shoes of the receiver for a moment.\u00a0If you received approximately 5-6 cold calls in a day, how many would you actually receive?\u00a0If you picked up the call, would you be willing to listen to their pitch?\u00a0Did you know that it takes\u00a08\u00a0cold\u00a0call attempts to reach a prospect?\u00a0Yes, that\u2019s the average number of cold calls you need to make. So, if you\u2019ve been giving up after just one call, you have just discovered the biggest error that you made.\u00a0Communication isn\u2019t what it used to be earlier. Before one or two decades, we relied highly on phones. Now, we have different means of communicating, such as messaging applications, video calling, emails outreach, etc.\u00a0The myth \u201cCold calling is dead\u201d has been circulating in the industry for years, and for the right reasons, even our marketing strategies have evolved.\u00a0However, giving up on an effective cold outreach practice because of a myth is also not fair.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So, this week, I reached out to 7 sales experts and asked for insight on this myth and whether they think it\u2019s true or not.\u00a0Is cold calling really dead? Let\u2019s hear from the industry experts!\u00a0Alina ClarkDawn LandryJonathan SaeidianAndrew FiebertEwen FinserVignesh WadarajanAndrei Breaz1. Alina ClarkCo-Founder,\u00a0CocoDoc\u00a0By all means, the idea that cold-calling is dead is a lie unto itself. Cold-calling is not dead. The only thing that has changed about cold calling is how it\u2019s done, and the results from a cold calling campaign.\u00a0\u00a0Salespeople who make truly cold calls- calls where you know absolutely nothing about the prospect are the ones on the receiving end of the cold calling downs. In today\u2019s world, there\u2019s really no need of calling someone if you don\u2019t know anything about them. Having customer data, and massive personalization has made cold calling different but not dead.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The use of data has tuned most of the cold calling into some form of mild warm-calling. For marketers, knowing something about the prospect helps build rapport and authentic connections. In the past, cold calling was a \u201cfrom-the-scratch\u201d process, but not anymore. While the original cold calling, where salespeople went in blind, is dead, but there\u2019s a new form of calling in place of it.\u00a02. Dawn LandryFounder,\u00a0Authentizity\u00a0The answer to this question depends upon your definition of \u201ccold calling\u201d; it also depends upon the company\u2019s type of sales/business development. Is it B2C? B2B?\u00a0I started my career with the true definition of yellow page and door-to-door cold calling in the B2B, service-based industry. If that is the market sector that you are speaking of, then yes. Cold calling is dead.\u00a0For sustainable success, business development is relational and not transactional.\u00a03. Jonathan\u00a0SaeidianFounder & CEO,\u00a0Brenton Way\u00a0Cold\u00a0calls\u00a0are far from being dead.\u00a0Yes! Optimized and\u00a0scripted calls\u00a0could help productivity, but personalized cold\u00a0calls work best all the time. You might see it as inactive only because you are doing it wrong; you should learn how to use it to be alive and effective. It won\u2019t suck if your\u00a0calls sound sincere and show\u00a0personalization.\u00a0Never equate cold\u00a0calls\u00a0to boring\u00a0calls, they are\u00a0different.\u00a0You can make your cold\u00a0calls\u00a0more alive and effective to generate more leads.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a04. Andrew Fiebert\u00a0Founder & CEO,\u00a0Lasso\u00a0I agree that \u201ccold calling is dead.\u201d\u00a0Many people nowadays simply won\u2019t pick up the phone if it\u2019s a number they don\u2019t recognize, and they aren\u2019t likely to listen to a voicemail that\u2019s left either. Even if they do pick up or listen to your message, they won\u2019t necessarily trust you\u00a0or your\u00a0product as they have nothing else to reference and can\u2019t be sure it\u2019s\u00a0not just\u00a0spam.\u00a0In contrast, a cold email works better\u00a0because you can provide more information about your product or service and prove your authenticity via the email address it was sent from. They can easily click on\u00a0a link\u00a0to learn more, rather than having to hang up the phone then manually\u00a0search for\u00a0your business.\u00a0\u00a05. Ewen FinserCEO,\u00a0The Digital Merchant\u00a0Cold calling is\u00a0NOT\u00a0dead. If it is, you can also consider all unsolicited communications as dead, like email campaigns and pop-up advertisements. The effectiveness of cold calling only boils down to two things:\u00a0Who are you calling?\u00a0The pre-qualifications before doing a cold call\u00a0are\u00a0very crucial. Make sure to do your homework before hitting that call button.\u00a0So,\u00a0ask yourself, does this person really need my product or services? Is this the right person to speak about our product?\u00a0\u00a0How can I make this person\u2019s life better?\u00a0Once you have found the right prospect, the next thing you need to ask is how you can create value for them. If your main goal for cold calling is only to sell, consider your campaign a failure. The main objective of cold calling goes beyond selling. It should be establishing an engaging and worthwhile conversation with your prospect. Relationships and genuine connections are prerequisites if you want to crea"

So, if you come across a familiar advertisement while you\u2019re browsing online, that\u2019s retargeting.And while it could be an effective practice for marketers, the audience might feel that they\u2019re being stalked.\u201cRetargeting is a creepy stalker\u201d \u2013 This is a myth that has affected many marketers, which led them to believe that retargeting practice isn\u2019t worth it.So, this week I reached out to 7 experts that helped me unveil yet another myth.Hear from the experts \u2013 Is retargeting a creepy stalker?1.\u00a0Anatolii\u00a0Ulitovskyi\u00a0Founder,\u00a0SEOtools\u00a0All marketing methods are creepy stalkers. Most methods don\u2019t work for each company. It\u2019s better to find what works for you considering your preferences and unique selling proposition. Retargeting is a powerful tool that helps to get customers back. These myths appeal because of low brand recognition or poor quality of products. Customers are clever than ever. They read reviews before buying. If retargeting doesn\u2019t work for you then it\u2019s better to analyze what kind of other problems you might have.\u00a0\u00a02. Brian Dean\u00a0Founder,\u00a0Exploding Topics\u00a0To be honest, remarketing has been proven time and time again to be effective. Remarketing has been found to be effective by a large number of advertisers. To be honest, we use remarketing and it has worked out nicely for us.\u00a0\u00a0You can also use remarketing to better match a visitor\u2019s individual needs. It\u2019s possible to display a targeted ad to someone who\u2019s already shown interest in bikini swimwear, along with an additional incentive that could persuade them to rethink their opinion, like a \u201c20% off\u201d discount. And that seems like a reasonable usage because if your visitor sees an offer like that, or free delivery, etc., they could reconsider buying from you.\u00a03. Joseph Bushnell\u00a0Founder,\u00a0Joseph Bushnell\u00a0I do see why people can get a bit freaked out the first time they notice they are being retargeted. However, I think awareness has developed to a point that most consumers know what it is happening, even if they don\u2019t fully understand the technology behind it. Personally, I love being retargeted. On many occasions I intended to read or buy something but I got distracted and then forgot about it. Luckily a retargeting ad served as a very useful reminder to go back and finish up where I left off. There\u2019s no need to fear retargeting. Embrace it!\u00a04. Kenneth MackayGoogle Ads Specialist,\u00a0Initiative2\u00a0Retargeting is not the issue; it\u2019s how it\u2019s used.\u00a0A stalker is an unwelcome follower.\u00a0But if you really like someone, and see them everywhere, that\u2019s great.\u00a0So,\u00a0it is with retargeting.\u00a0Make sure you retarget the right people, and make sure you display relevant and useful stuff.\u00a0Then you\u2019re not a stalker; they\u2019re flattered that you\u2019re paying them\u00a0attention.\u00a05. Greg Gillman\u00a0Chief Revenue Officer,\u00a0Mutesix\u00a0As with any myth, marketing misinformation is floating around out there and should be debunked. This is why it\u2019s essential that businesses do their own research, and closely monitor their data and marketing strategies to separate fact from\u00a0fiction.\u00a0For\u00a0example, some may (falsely) believe that social media campaigns work only for specific demographics. However, in reality, this is probably due to the fact that they aren\u2019t looking at the right platforms. Often, a strategy isn\u2019t a poor idea on its own, but it isn\u2019t being implemented correctly. To solve for this, segment your audiences, look at target demographics, and then create separate campaigns that will cater toward those particular users. When you do your due diligence like this, you are able to see with your own eyes how accurate sweeping beliefs are in reality.\u00a06. Andrew\u00a0Maff\u00a0Founder,\u00a0BlueTuskr\u00a0Retargeting is a pretty standard practice but it can act like a creepy stalker. Every piece of data a company has on\u00a0you\u00a0can and will be used against you. However, people should also know that the company is only doing it because they want to show you what you\u2019re most interested in. If you saw a bunch of ads that you didn\u2019t care about at all it would probably be more annoying than consistently seeing things you already like.\u00a07. Liz RaadCo-Founder,\u00a0eBusiness\u00a0Institute\u00a0The line \u2018Retargeting is a creepy stalker\u2019 is very much a myth to any marketer who values display ads, automated and subscription marketing and overall driving traffic.\u00a0People\u00a0gloss over\u00a0that website\u00a0seek to obtain\u00a0informed consent\u00a0from their users\u00a0to share key information that could have been missed on the user\u2019s first stop to the website.Retargeting is more like an effective virtual assistant that can help consumers identify what they like the best, and see only\u00a0their preferences. This can help form lasting brand awareness connections, empowering customers to make better, more informed choices in their purchasing journeys.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It\u00a0al"

            "content": "Sales reps make numerous amounts of sales calls during their day. But have you ever wondered how many of them are actually effective?\u00a0The adage, \u201cmore calls equal to more leads,\u201d no longer stands true. In fact, this is one of the most common myths sales reps are persuaded to believe.\u00a0\u00a0Salespeople spend\u00a0one-third of their day\u00a0just talking to their prospects. This reflects how essential sales calls are for the company. Moreover, it becomes even more crucial to track the sales call performance.\u00a0I\u2019ve listed down ways to measure and track your sales call performance, so you can improve your productivity and crush your sales quotas.\u00a0Measure sales call performance and achieve your sales goals\u00a0In order to accurately measure your sales call performance, you need to constantly optimize your strategy and implement methods that work for your sales reps. Below methods of measuring sales call performance will help you set clear goals and track sales calls.1. Find out how the sales rep handles and qualifies leads\u00a0In sales, every lead should be nurtured equally and qualified according to their response. Therefore, it\u2019s imperative to identify the process of lead qualification done by your sales reps.\u00a0Are the sales reps considering the prospect\u2019s interests?\u00a0\u00a0Has every prospect been followed up with?\u00a0How many follow-ups are your sales reps doing before categorizing them as not interested?\u00a0The above factors play a vital role in qualifying leads, so you need to know that your sales reps are following the lead qualification checklist.\u00a0\u00a0Did you know that 60% of customers say no four times before saying yes, while\u00a048% of salespeople\u00a0don\u2019t even make a single follow-up attempt? Based on this data, more and more sales reps need to start following up more than once if they want to score more leads.2. Determine average sales per sales rep and per team\u00a0When we talk about measuring the sales call performance, it basically comes down to numbers.\u00a0\u00a0This calculation measures the efficiency of sales calls made by the sales rep or the sales team. This indicates how many deals your sales rep or team closed compared to the number of sales calls they made.\u00a0If the conversion rate is average or high, it means that your sales team and reps are performing well. But, if they\u2019re making, say, 50 calls a day but not closing any deals, it shows that the sales calls are not that effective and action needs to be taken.\u00a0You can find the issue and provide training to sales reps that are underperforming, so it doesn\u2019t affect your company\u2019s revenue in the long run.3. What\u2019s the average handling time?\u00a0Yes, the quality of sales calls matters more than the number of sales calls made per day. However, do you know how much time the sales rep is spending on one sales call?\u00a0To measure the average handling time, you need to divide the length of all calls made by the total number of calls.\u00a0For example,You made 30 sales calls yesterday.So, you divide 150 by 30, which brings you 5.Here, the average sales call duration is 5 minutes.Generally, low average handling time indicates low-quality sales calls as you could not keep the prospect engaged.\u00a0\u00a0At the same time, a very high average handling time also indicates that something is not working out between your sales rep and the prospects. Therefore, you need to consider your industry and target audience when setting a benchmark for average handling time.4. What is the average hold time for sales calls?\u00a0Often, sales reps aren\u2019t able to reach the prospects as they didn\u2019t attend the call or it went to voicemail. In such a scenario, interested prospects might call you back.\u00a0The average hold time represents how long the customer has to wait before a sales rep picks up the call. Ideally, the average hold time should be kept low if you want to convert more prospects into customers.\u00a0Having a low average hold time also reduces call abandonment as the customers don\u2019t have to wait too long. This way, you can improve the efficiency of sales calls and keep your customers happy at the same time.5. How much time is after-call work taking up?\u00a0A sales call doesn\u2019t end with just one conversation; there are minor tasks and paperwork to be done in between each call.\u00a0\u00a0After the sales call ends, a sales rep needs to fill in the required information in their CRM or manually log in the summary and key points of the sales call.\u00a0\u00a0Usually, sales reps hurry to move from one call to another, so it\u2019s necessary to check how efficiently the after-call work is done. You can lose a prospect if any information is miswritten in between the calls.\u00a0Therefore, find out how much time sales reps are taking to perform these tasks in between their calls and check if the information entered is correct or not.6. Examine the quality of sales calls\u00a0In the end, it\u2019s the quality of sales calls that will get you more leads; hence it\u2019s one of the most important factors you need to keep an eye on.\u00a0You can only convert your prospects into customers when you\u2019ve resolved all thei"

When you ask a lawyer for legal advice, they have a framework of questions they run through.The use of sales scripts and general cold outreach gives sales professionals a bad rep because they\u2019re often used by incompetent management in an attempt to scale a sales force that doesn\u2019t know how to sell.\u00a0Verdict \u2013\u00a0Sales scripts can prove highly beneficial when you know how to use them in your sales calling strategy.\u00a02.\u00a0Farzad\u00a0RashidiCo-founder,\u00a0Respona\u00a0It is a misconception that is not true in most situations. If you have any hesitance in your voice when reading the script, it can often translate to sounding scripted and robotic if they know what to look for.\u00a0\u00a0To avoid this, try using the script as a guideline instead of using it word for word, making sure to add in feedback or emotions where necessary throughout the conversation, so you don\u2019t come off as robotic when talking on the phone.\u00a0There are many ways of adding emotion into conversations besides just being \u201crobotic.\u201d For example, showing interest by repeating back some key information within a sentence or two will likely spark a more interesting conversation with whomever you\u2019re speaking with over the phone.\u00a0Verdict \u2013\u00a0If you don\u2019t want to sound like a robot, use the script as a guideline instead of being entirely dependent on it.\u00a03.\u00a0Greg\u00a0RozdebaPresident,\u00a0Dundas Life\u00a0If you sound like a robot when using sales scripts, then your delivery is the problem and not the script. You are probably just narrating the script instead of having a conversation with your prospect. This makes your whole delivery impersonal and ineffective. Be conversational and concise, and make the script truly your own. Personalize it so that you can hold your prospect\u2019s attention throughout. Finally, your focus and delivery should be on the prospect, not on your product.\u00a0Verdict \u2013\u00a0It\u2019s the delivery of the speech that makes the conversation impersonal and\u00a0ineffective, not the sales scripts.\u00a04.\u00a0Sanket\u00a0ShahCEO,\u00a0InVideo\u00a0This is a very common misconception.\u00a0\u00a0Most top organizations use a structured sales pitch with their customers. Their sales expert makes a perfect sales pitch in the form of scripts for every customer, which matches the voice of their brand. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s robotic; that means they have been given proper structure training.\u00a0Verdict \u2013\u00a0Using a structured sales pitch enables sales reps to engage better\u00a05. Alicia\u00a0ShevetoneExecutive vice president,\u00a0Skillsource LearningI have been in\u00a0sales for over 20 years. We focus, in part, on sales transformation and enablement. My perspective is that using scripts do not make you sound like a robot.\u00a0 Reading from a script makes you sound like a robot. Having a script ensures that you remember the points you must convey during your conversation. With practice, you will no longer need them. What is worse? Sounding too rehearsed, or winging it and neglecting to convey to your prospect how you can make an impact?\u00a0Verdict \u2013\u00a0Reading\u00a0directly from the sales script makes you sound like a robot, but when you use the key points in your speech, it can prove to be highly beneficial.\u00a06. Lisa\u00a0OdenwellerCEO,\u00a0Kroma\u00a0Wellness\u00a0Sales scripts can make you sound like a robot. The point of them is to act as a framework while on a sales call \u2014 it\u2019s up to an effective salesperson to use their personality and social skills to make the script work for them. No one wants to talk to a robot \u2014 our lives are automated enough as is. People are looking for a human connection.\u00a0Verdict \u2013\u00a0To provide a human connection when talking to prospects, use sales scripts as a framework rather than just a scripted conversation.\u00a07.\u00a0Jeremy Miner"

Bootstrapping the\u00a0business led\u00a0her to be creative in getting the business off the ground.\u00a0She got inspired to create a community with vegan wine for wine lovers who have been overlooked and underrepresented by the wine industry.

Thus,\u00a021st August is dedicated to celebrating the achievements of entrepreneurs.\u00a0\u00a0Entrepreneurship makes you aware of the beautiful reality of what you are capable to achieve and how it can positively impact your life. Thus, to draw inspiration, I\u00a0reached out to a few entrepreneurs and asked them five simple questions.\u00a0Now, the beauty of this article lies in how you\u2019ll find different and inspiring responses\u00a0to the same five questions. Each entrepreneur has had a unique journey to reach where they are right now. So if\u00a0you\u2019re about to take a leap and build a business, this article can be that much-needed boost for you!\u00a0So, without further ado, let\u2019s go ahead and look at what these entrepreneurs have to share with us!\u00a0Words of wisdom on world entrepreneurs day\u00a0A. Alexander De Ridder\u00a0Co-Founder,\u00a0INK1. What was the key driving force of your journey to become an\u00a0entrepreneur?\u00a0I saw a major shift in search caused by\u00a0Rankbrain\u2019s\u00a0introduction in 2016. Beyond keywords, search engines could now understand the meaning behind the words and measure user intent with quality signals to close the loop.\u00a0\u00a0I realized how these changes could create major opportunities for content\u00a0creators. My\u00a0immediate thought was: How can we help content creators stay on top of a quickly evolving industry so that their target audiences can find their content, engage with it, and convert because of it? How do we help writers tie their efforts to\u00a0ROI? In\u00a0answering these questions, the idea for the INK company and our AI SEO software was born.\u00a0\u00a0There was a clear need for a tool like INK, but nothing like it\u2026yet. Our\u00a0mission became helping content creators put their energy into content that performs: is found, is engaging, and\u00a0converts! After\u00a0we refined what worked, it was time to build the technology to help content creators win on the web. We went to work building the INK software and the revolutionary AI that powers it.2. What are the major challenges you faced during the inception of the company?\u00a0As a fast-growing start-up, there were a few challenges. The way we solved these challenges was to contemplate the idea, listen to our users, and iterate until we achieved that ideal. The first one was to understand how the heck Google ranks content.\u00a0\u00a0That\u2019s definitely a big challenge. Related to this is the fact that \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d AIs just didn\u2019t make the cut. You can\u2019t build a product like INK using off-the-shelf AI products. We had to design this from the ground\u00a0up. Very\u00a0early on we had a discussion asking ourselves if we would create an enterprise version and charge for it or would we make this free?\u00a0\u00a0And very early on, we decided that we wanted to make the core of INK free for everyone, with later the addition of pro and business features. To think of a way to approach that goal in a way that is not going to bankrupt you and how to make it so efficient that it would be possible to offer a version for free AND scale, was probably the biggest challenge\u00a03. Is there a quote or phrase that you look up to for motivation?\u00a0\u201cDo or do not, there is no try.\u201d \u2014 Yoda\u00a04. Do you believe that there\u2019s one full-proof formula for becoming an entrepreneur?\u00a0\u00a0Choose company values early on, and use them as a guiding force for building your team. For example, our values empower everyone who works with us to be Innovative, Driven, Passionate, and Elevating in every aspect of their work.\u00a0\u00a0These values are the glue that binds our remote team together, sets a clear standard, and keeps everyone rowing in the same direction toward a shared goal. They are also instrumental in hiring new talent and measuring performance.\u00a05. What learnings you would want to pass on to start-up entrepreneurs?\u00a0Whatever your powerful secret sauce is \u2014 focus on that. There might be other products and solutions out there, but what makes yours better? Why should anyone use it over that of your competitors? Have a clearly defined purpose: Know what problem you are solving and who you are solving it for.\u00a0B.\u00a0Liviu Tanase\u00a0CEO,\u00a0ZeroBounce\u00a01. What was the key driving force of your journey to become an entrepreneur?\u00a0My key driving force has always been the desire to be better. The fact that I could expand my knowledge and improve my skills meant that I could be of better service to those around me. This drive has never left me. Even today, more than 17 years since I started my first business, it\u2019s still what keeps me up at night and gets me out of bed every morning.\u00a02.

That\u2019s when you know that you\u2019ve scored a prospect and there\u2019s hope for closing the\u00a0deal.\u00a0Before you schedule a meeting with your prospect and dazzle them with a strong value proposition, you need\u00a0to persuade the prospect with an appointment call.\u00a0\u00a0No one likes cold calling hundreds of prospects just to end up with one or two appointments.\u00a0Here\u2019s where you need to stay alert and implement\u00a0hacks that work in your favor\u00a0by perfect the sales appointment call.\u00a0\u00a0Did you know that 82%\u00a0of\u00a0buyers accept meetings\u00a0when salespeople reach out to\u00a0them.\u00a0Now it\u2019s pretty much up to the salesperson to leave a lasting impression during\u00a0a\u00a0sales appointment call.\u00a0Solid tips and tricks to excel at every sales appointment call.\u00a0\u00a01. Know your prospect beforehand\u00a0Suppose you made an appointment call, the prospect answers; now what?\u00a0\u00a0You need to have a clear plan and knowledge about\u00a0the prospect and only then you\u2019ll be able to hold a\u00a0conversation.\u00a0In fact,\u00a082% of B2B decision-makers\u00a0think sales reps are unprepared.\u00a0And it\u2019s time for you to change this perception.\u00a0Do thorough research before making an appointment call. It includes \u2013\u00a0\u00a0Who is your prospect?\u00a0What\u2019s your purpose for the appointment call?\u00a0What are their pain points?\u00a0What you\u2019re offering?\u00a0Just knowing about these points will give you an edge and help you get that appointment!\u00a02. Pick a\u00a0convenient time to make an appointment call\u00a0The first and foremost thing that every salesperson needs to consider is the time at which they\u2019re planning to make a call.\u00a0if you\u2019re about to call a prospect in a different time zone, check the time difference and see whether it would\u00a0be an appropriate time to make an appointment call.\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, once the prospect receives the call, ensure you ask them if they have a few minutes to spare for a quick conversation. This reflects your politeness and makes you seem considerate about their time.\u00a0Usually, decision-makers have packed schedules so sometimes they might not be able to talk to you. in such a case, if you\u2019ve opened the conversation in a polite manner, they\u2019re more likely to provide you with a\u00a0convenient time for an appointment call.\u00a0\u00a03. Don\u2019t\u00a0show desperation\u00a0Yes, prospects do need persuading when you\u2019re trying to set an appointment. However, that also doesn\u2019t mean that you have to pressure them into getting\u00a0your way.\u00a0\u00a0It gets annoying and comes off as unrespectful.\u00a0Instead of\u00a0pressuring\u00a0your prospects into getting an appointment, you can do the following \u2013\u00a0\u00a0Use a persuasive yet polite tone\u00a0\u00a0Exchange customer success stories to build trust\u00a0Have a discussion around their pain pointsUse facts and figures to get them interested\u00a0Provide them with options instead of asking open-ended questions\u00a0The above points will help you score an appointment without putting in the extra effort. Just set the flow of the conversation and you\u2019ll have an appointment scheduled with your prospect!\u00a04. Leverage the prospect\u2019s actions for better outreach\u00a0Yes, it\u2019s important to reach out to prospects that have actively shown interest in your product/service.\u00a0But, it\u2019s also essential to keep an eye on your possible prospects that indirectly engages with your company in form of \u2013\u00a0\u00a0Downloading resources from your website\u00a0Attends regular events and webinars\u00a0Visits specific landing pages on your website\u00a0Engages with you on various social media platforms\u00a0You\u2019d be surprised by how many interesting prospects you will find from these mentioned methods. Some prospects might be looking for a solution without even knowing. And being a smart salesperson, you need to stay proactive and connect with them.\u00a0In the era where Millennials are dominating the market, engaging via social media channels and dropping voicemails is as\u00a0good a sales call strategy as anything else.\u00a0\u00a05. Build a strong rapport among your prospects\u00a0A salesperson\u2019s rapport matters as much as the value proposition and product/service.\u00a0\u201cRapport is the link between meeting and communicating.\u201d \u2013 Nicholas Boothman\u00a0Your prospect doesn\u2019t want to talk to a robot; they are looking for real and engaging conversations. Hence, be the real you, connect with prospects, and get customers for life!\u00a0\u00a0Build a solid foundation with a good rapport and open the sales appointment call with confidence. Focus on your prospect and get them comfortable to talk so you can later get that appointment you were looking for.\u00a0Remember, at this stage of a sales process, your end goal is to get an appointment scheduled, not to make a sale.\u00a0So,\u00a0forget about selling for a minute and just focus on leaving a lasting impression on your prospect.\u00a06. Handle objections in a smart way\u00a0Even though you have qualified your prospects, they might still have objections, and that\u2019s completely normal.\u00a0To convince your prospect, you first need to understand their objections.\u00a0Objections don\u2019t always mean that the prospect doesn\u2019t agree with you; sometimes they might be looking for something else.

Roy\u00a0Morejon\u00a0President and Co-Founder,\u00a0Enventys\u00a0Partners\u00a0When it comes to sales, the goal is to be effective\u2013more doesn\u2019t always mean better.\u00a0\u00a0Convenience\u00a0and user mobility\u00a0are two significant\u00a0trends in consumers\u2019 perception\u00a0of a brand. Often there are many competitors for a product, so what makes your brand different?\u00a0\u00a0When pitching your product, the best\u00a0sales\u00a0techniques that work are:\u00a0\u00a0\nHonesty.\u00a0Not everyone is going to benefit in the same amount from your product. It\u2019s important to be honest and realistic with customers about the extent to which a product can help them. Useability.\u00a0How is this product actually going to help a customer? Where are the gaps in their\u00a0business or life? This product can help fill?\u00a03. Kris LippiCEO,\u00a0ISoldMyHouse\u00a0More calls equal to more leads is one of the most prominent principles in selling wherein global-scale sales enterprises like call centers and telemarketing agencies\u2019 business models sprung from.\u00a0The only reason this fundamental strategy has been washed down and labeled as a myth is because of the internet-induced modernization.\u00a0\u00a0Regardless, every sales strategy of today still revolves around communicating with the market so making more sales calls in an internet-centric era still results in increased lead generation. All it takes is to prompt awareness of, and interest in,\u00a0your\u00a0offering through whatever internet- or traditionally-powered communication device or channel.\u00a04. Jeff Walker\u00a0CEO,\u00a0Bestvpncanada\u00a0Just because sales\u00a0is\u00a0a numbers game doesn\u2019t mean that having a high volume of calls would equate to having more leads too.\u00a0\u00a0For me, it\u2019s not the number of calls you make that\u2019ll enable you to book more appointments. Instead, it\u2019s about concentrating on calling the right prospects that you\u2019ll be able to have great numbers. Relying on making more than a hundred calls a day to have more leads is just like a game of luck, you don\u2019t have total control of the outcome.\u00a0\u00a0But with efficient and great calling techniques, more leads are always guaranteed.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a05. Sharon Van\u00a0Donkelaar\u00a0CMO,\u00a0Expandi\u00a0The logic behind that is that the more calls you make, the more opportunities you have to take a lead. If you only make, let\u2019s say, 20 calls, you only have 20 opportunities, and the statistics say that it usually takes up to 8 calls to reach a prospect, so our 20 calls fall short.\u00a0\u00a0The more calls you make, the more opportunities you have to connect with someone interested, still, the system, the people you\u2019re calling, and your natural talent for sales are the ultimate combo that will help you actually generate a lead.\u00a06. Sam Shepler\u00a0CEO,\u00a0TestimonialHero\u00a0Do more calls equal more leads? Yes, definitely. However, \u2018more calls\u2019 is an ambiguous term since what do \u2018more calls\u2019 really mean? Does it mean making 100 or more calls a day?If that\u2019s the case, my answer is no, as I believe meaningful and quality conversations should always be above quantity.Nonetheless, making more calls a day will undoubtedly result in more leads, as long as they\u2019re done correctly and with the intent of actually generating leads rather than just making them reach a particular milestone.\u00a07. Paige\u00a0Arnof-Fenn\u00a0CEO,\u00a0Mavens & Moguls\u00a0I disagree, in my experience, it is about quality, not quantity.\u00a0 The\u00a0worst time to call prospects in any region is\u00a08-10 am\u00a0when everyone is rushing to work and preparing for the day so calling them is a waste of time.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Quality calls to the right target with the right message/offer results in more leads.

            "title": "Myth busted! Sales performance is defined by achieved sales goal",
            "content": "Sales reps are constantly trying to close more deals and achiever their quota. However, is it fair to define sales performance based on a sales rep\u2019s achieved sales goal?\u00a0Let\u2019s take an example of the recent world pandemic which turned our lives upside down. Due to the onset of the pandemic, 40% of companies failed to meet their sales goals in 2022. \u00a0Now, this data simply represents how Covid-19 affected everyone\u2019s businesses. So, you can\u2019t say that the sales rep had underperformed just because the sales goal wasn\u2019t achieved. In fact, the company\u2019s sales reps might have put more effort into achieving their sales goals considering how all the companies were affected.\u00a0To gain insight into this myth, I reached out to a few experts and asked for their inputs on this myth.\u00a01. Christian Velitchkov\u00a0Co-Founder, Twiz LLC\u00a0The success of sales depends a lot on the sales goal number achieved, but that is not the sole parameter to judge the success of a sales team. Sales are not just selling the products today and achieving the sales target, it\u2019s about maintaining relations with your customer. \u00a0Even after selling the product the process of sales doesn\u2019t end, you have to entertain customer queries and complaints and provide solutions to their problems. Many times you cannot make a sale, but you develop a relationship with the party, which can turn into a sale someday. Ensuring such friendly relations will make the sales team successful.\u00a02. Georgi TodorovFounder, ThriveMyWay\u00a0This myth is by those people who believe that they need to make 100 calls in order to get 5 leads and make 1 sale. That\u2019s lousy thinking.\u00a0\u00a0I used to cold call businesses trying to sell them SEO services back in 2013-2014. I failed tremendously despite the fact I was making 30 calls a day.\u00a0\u00a0A couple of years later I am not even trying to sell but I am getting new leads on a daily basis. And I make 0 calls. My performance is much better. Focus on performance, not on numbers.\u00a03. Nick Shackelford\u00a0Managing Partner, Structured Agency\u00a0A successful sales performance is measured by the outcome of short and long-term goals. The actual technique employed by a sales team may not necessarily be reflective of its results. Sometimes the issues creating lower numbers can be mismarketing and the lack of a cohesive strategy to target the right consumers who match your \u201cproduct/market\u201d fit.\u00a04. David FernandezCEO, Captial Dealer Solutions\u00a0\u00a0Although achieved sales goal number is a part of measuring sales performance, it does not define a sales member\u2019s performance alone.\u00a0You can use different performance metrics to measure sales performance, such as the basis on average deal size. If you look at this area on a monthly or quarterly basis, you can get an overview of the contracts held by your sales team member.\u00a0Generally, if your team is trying to move up the market, you will be eager to increase the average deal size. If your team is trying to land SMB customers, you will want the number to go down, increasing overall revenues and number of customers.\u00a0In addition to this, you should look for your salespeople with a significantly smaller average deal size, so you should know which team member you need to motivate into working hard and improving their sales or team performance. \u00a0\u00a05. Chris Riley\u00a0CEO and Co-founder, USA Rx\u00a0\u201cSales performance is defined by the achieved sales goal number.\u201d This is definitely a myth. So much goes into measuring the performance of a particular sales strategy, that actually achieving the end goals is not the only concern.\u00a0What is your ROI? How are your conversions? Are your site visitors showing\u00a0a steady increase? While everyone wants to reach their goals, the journey on how they get there is just as important. Plus, paying attention to this data can help your team decide when to pivot, or when they\u2019re running the perfect campaign.\u00a06. Hector Gutierrez\u00a0CEO, JOI\u00a0It\u2019s not quite as simple as that. A sale is a sale, but one sale doesn\u2019t mean the customer is dedicated to the brand in the long run. How that relationship evolves into a sustained one is much more key than the sale itself. If someone buys our product and never buys again, we want to know everything we can about why \u2014 and use that feedback to improve the experience as much as we can. Looking at only numbers means missing the bigger picture.\u00a07. Khari WashingtonOwner, 1st United Realty & Mortgage\u00a0Sales goal numbers are an important metric, but the metric doesn\u2019t work for every industry. If a company needs high customer retention to be profitable, customer satisfaction could be just as important as the number of sales. The sales goal number is not a one size fits all solution to tracking success.\u00a08. Matthew Paxton\u00a0Founder, Hypernia\u00a0When we look at good results, it is easy to assume that it was caused by good performance. We don\u2019t think about how much luck was involved. For obvious reasons. First, we don\u2019t want to offend the person who worked hard. Second, it is hard to quantify luck.\u00a0Maybe the su"

            "content": "Having a strong brand presence is essential for every company and marketing plays a vital role in the process. By showcasing your company\u2019s value proposition to the target audience, you\u2019re capturing their attention, hence encouraging them to become your customers.\u00a0Now, when we talk about the terms like marketing or advertising, the first thought that comes into our mind is of those campaigns that we come across on different channels.\u00a0Since these two terms are closely connected, the myth was born \u2013 Advertising is the same as marketing.\u00a0However, as we all know that not all myths are believable, so I wanted to find out whether advertising is indeed the same as marketing or not. For that, I reached out to industry experience and asked for their contribution.\u00a0This week, I\u2019m featuring 11 experts that helped be bust this age-old myth of advertising and marketing! \u00a0Table of content\u00a0Kent Lewis\u00a0Max Benz\u00a0Sam Wright\u00a0Rytis Lauris\u00a0Andre Kazimierski\u00a0Charly Chow\u00a0Ali Payani\u00a0Ravi parikh\u00a0David Clelland\u00a0Scott Keever\u00a0Grace Everitt\u00a0Is advertising the same as marketing? Let\u2019s hear from the experts\u00a01. Kent Lewis\u00a0President & Founder, Anvil\u00a0Marketing, by definition, includes advertising, public relations, promotions, events, direct response and all things digital (marketing).\u00a0Saying advertising is the same as marketing is like saying PR is the same as marketing. One is a subset of the other. PR, advertising and other marketing disciplines are a subset of marketing. Period. I\u2019m personally annoyed when people in my industry (digital marketing) interchange the term \u201csearch engine marketing\u201d or SEM with \u201cpay-per-click\u201d or PPC. One is a subset of the other. SEM includes advertising and search engine optimization (SEO).\u00a0PPC only includes any form of digital advertising that relies on the payment on a per-click basis (typically text ads on Google and Bing). I wish more marketers were properly schooled, as I was when I graduated with a business degree and marketing concentration.\u00a02. Max Benz\u00a0Founder & CEO, remote-job.net\u00a0Many people use the terms advertising and marketing interchangeably, but there are several notable differences between the two. While advertising is a form of marketing, the field is much broader than just putting ads on Facebook. Today we are destroying the myth that advertising and marketing are the same.\u00a0Marketing\u00a0Marketing is the umbrella under which advertising falls. Other parts of marketing include public relations, product pricing, product distribution, sales strategy, market research, consumer testing, media campaign design and even community events. The term marketing can be used to describe every way that your business makes contact with a customer. In those terms, advertising can be a type of marketing, but it isn\u2019t the only type of marketing.\u00a0Advertising\u00a0Advertising describes outreach to potential consumers with the goal of them making a purchase. Advertising is typically paid for and can be done on a variety of platforms. It is typically the largest expense that a marketing department will have.\u00a0Advertising includes:\u00a0\u00a0Direct mail\u00a0\u00a0Newspapers\u00a0\u00a0Magazines\u00a0\u00a0Radio/podcasts\u00a0\u00a0Internet\u00a0\u00a0Television\u00a0Your Marketing Plan\u00a0Think of your marketing department like the team needed to build a home. To build a new home, you will need a large team with an architect, construction workers, project managers, plumbers, electricians, painters and movers. Each part needs to cooperate with the other parts towards your ultimate goal\u2014building your house. Your marketing department is made up of several different parts that might seem independent, but they need to all work together to build your brand.\u00a03. Sam Wright\u00a0Managing director, Blink\u00a0The difference between marketing and advertising is essentially one of strategy versus execution. Both are important, but without planning your campaign properly then any advertising tactics you use \u2013 whether it\u2019s paid advertising, social media or even SEO \u2013 are likely to fall short.\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019ve worked on hundreds of campaigns over the years, and without a doubt this is the most common reason for things not working as they should. But when you combine great execution with a solid marketing foundation \u2013 in particular effective positioning and categorization \u2013 then the results can be transformative.\u00a04. Rytis Lauris\u00a0CEO, Omnisend\u00a0Advertising is definitely not the same as marketing. In a basic way, advertising is a type of marketing, where you\u2019re trying to get people to see your product or service via paid channels. However, advertising generally gets a bad rep because it\u2019s often done badly. The best advertising, the best marketing, is always about getting the right message to the right person at the right time. If so, then advertising becomes an indispensable part of your marketing strategy.\u00a05. Andre Kazimierski\u00a0CEO, Improovy\u00a0Advertising is one way to exercise a marketing method, but advertising is not marketing in and of itself. It is a subcategory that falls under the realm of marketing. Marketing is the way a"

I think one of the best ways to increase open rates is to use\u00a0personalized marketing.\u00a0In the subject line you should use the customer\u2019s name, what is in their cart, or a personalized deal based on data you have from previous shopping or from email list\u00a0forms.\u00a0Since\u00a072% of consumers exclusively respond or click through on personalized marketing,\u00a0this is a fantastic way to increase open rates.\u00a03. Lily\u00a0Ugbaja\u00a0Founder,\u00a0DollarCreed\u00a0I truly believe the day and time you send emails, affect their open rate. I do not think it is a myth. You should send emails during work hours; when people are likely to open it at their desk.\u00a0Optimal times are the beginning of the workday and towards the end of workday. Ideal days are also Mondays and Fridays; being that they are the beginning and end of the week.4. Catherine Way\u00a0Marketing Manager,\u00a0Prime Plus Mortgage\u00a0I believe this is a myth. I think what is more important for increasing your open rates is a clean email list (sending to the right people who opt-in and remove any bounces or spam) and a click-worthy headline.5. Simon Brisk\u00a0Co-Founder and Commercial Director,\u00a0Click Intelligence\u00a0In my point of view, this is a complete email marketing myth that sending emails on a specific day will increase open rates. According to a survey conducted by\u00a0Campaign Monitor, 68% of Americans open emails based on who sent them.\u00a0If you want to increase your open rates it is always recommended to use personalization techniques because the open and click rate of these emails is higher. Other than this, focus on the subject line, design, and credibility of the email. You win half the battle when you craft a good subject line.\u00a06. Daniel Martin\u00a0Co-Founder,\u00a0LinkDoctor\u00a0This was quite true 2 years back.\u00a0But based on current data, it is so random these days.\u00a0\u00a0There are times where our weekend emails get reverted because prospects were checking emails using their tablets while lying on the couch. There are times when our early morning emails (as early as 6AM) got immediate responses from our prospects.\u00a0\u00a0I think everyone checks their emails regularly after getting up as a habit. But of course, the pitches need to stand out to get a response.\u00a07. Christine Elizabeth\u00a0Cooper\u00a0VP of Marketing,\u00a0KNB Communication\u00a0There is not\u00a0one\u00a0day of the week where all marketers should send out emails in order to achieve the best open rates. That is simply a myth.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, individual marketers can increase their open rates by knowing the optimal days\u2013and times\u2013their specific customers are online and receptive. Brands should do their own research and benchmarking to understand what those days and times are, and not rely on simple, generalized maxims.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a08.

            "content": "Social media is an integral part of every marketing strategy. However, there\u2019s a myth that says B2B social media marketing isn\u2019t effective. Despite social media being the most preferred marketing tool with 83% of the marketers using it, many still believe in the myth and don\u2019t implement social media strategy in their marketing process. The sole reason is this myth that mentions the ineffectiveness of B2B social media marketing.So, how do you perfect your marketing strategy? Is social media marketing effective or not? What\u2019s the truth behind this myth?You\u2019re at the right place! This week, I reached out to marketing experts and asked for their input so we can debunk yet another marketing myth. So, let\u2019s hear it from the experts!Is B2B social media marketing ineffective? Let\u2019s hear from the experts!1. Seth Price\u00a0Founding partner, Price Benowitz\u00a0B2B social media marketing can be extremely effective when done correctly. While you may think that social media is only for consumers, you also have to remember that most people are on social media in some way or another \u2013 business leaders included. In fact, more business leaders use social media now as a way to create a presence for themselves and for networking purposes which means there\u2019s an audience there. You\u2019ve also got to remember that social media doesn\u2019t only refer to Instagram, Facebook, or Youtube. There are a number of different professional social media sites around that can be very beneficial for marketing purposes (LinkedIn for example). While our law firm is mainly B2C focused, B2B social media marketing has been very beneficial for our digital agency in connecting with and helping other companies in the legal industry.\u00a02. Brittany Hardy\u00a0Owner, Empty Desk Solutions\u00a0I believe that if b2b social media marketing wasn\u2019t effective, then b2c social media marketing wouldn\u2019t be effective either, because at the end of the day, social media is all about being social, as the term suggests. If b2b businesses (I am in this category so I know it well\u2026) continue to focus on creating content that their audience craves, just as b2c businesses do, and if they continue (the b2b businesses) to build relationships and create conversations, then there is really no reason they can\u2019t be effective. I will also add\u2026 \u2018effective\u2019 can be a relatively subjective term and it\u2019s important for businesses to identify right off the bat what their true social media goals are so that they can take an objective look at what effective means to them and if they are indeed successful.\u00a03. Kingston Vickers\u00a0Aerospace Manager, Technetics Group\u00a0Social Media B2B Sales are my primary source of project level work, including new sales into new markets.\u00a0LinkedIn is a powerhouse for those efforts.\u00a0 The global reach for that platform, combined with a solutions-based approach, has yielded many new opportunities and sales.\u00a0Therefore, B2B social media marketing can be effective if you approach it the right way.4. Michelle Ebbin\u00a0Founder, JettProof\u00a0The idea that B2B social media marketing is ineffective is a complete myth.\u00a0Various studies as early as 2016 have already proven the crucial effects of social media for businesses and consumers alike.\u00a0A solid social media presence makes a business discoverable online and thus enhances collaboration and partnerships with other organizations. It\u2019s a sign of a bustling business and how ready it is to associate with other entities across industries.\u00a0Moreover, it\u2019s a platform that marketers use to listen in to the condition of the industry and the possible tactics to use to stand out from the competition.\u00a05. Tim Clarke\u00a0Director of sales, SEOBlog\u00a0I\u2019d say that B2B social media marketing becomes ineffective when the goals, purpose, platforms to be used, and target audience is not identified clearly.\u00a0The reach of social media is extensive and with many people engaged in using them for whichever reasons such as research, news, and communication \u2013 it is the best channel to reach your audience easily.\u00a0\u00a0With careful and intensive research, planning, and strategizing of using social media for B2B, I can say that it is highly effective.\u00a06. Brogan Renshaw\u00a0Director, Firewall Digital\u00a0Relevant retargeting ads make social media marketing in the B2B sphere highly effective and efficient. Social media is an effective marketing tool for B2B businesses to increase and maintain traffic on their site. Targeted ads pique the interest of a visitor and relevant retargeted ads keep them interested.\u00a0This approach humanizes your businesses\u2019 brand because the ads resonate with the viewer. Compared to obsolete unsolicited advertisements, social media advertising has a more personal appeal to people.\u00a0\u00a0The moment an ad connects to the emotions of a person is when conversion happens.\u00a07. Hillary Keller\u00a0CMO, Flatirons Development\u00a0This one actually isn\u2019t entirely a myth.. I\u2019d just rewrite this to say \u2018B2B social media marketing isn\u2019t as effective a direct sales channel as B2C social media marketing is.\u2019\u00a0So"

Simon\u00a0ElkjaerThe reality behind sales myth \u2013 Manager doesn\u2019t make a good sales coach\u00a0Let\u2019s hear from the experts of the industry what they think about it.1. Ruben GamezCEO,\u00a0Docsketch\u00a0Managers can make great sales coaches as long as they put sufficient time into it.\u00a0This myth started propagating when certain managers started\u00a0byte-sized inconsistent coaching, which ends up helping nobody. With a solid plan and proper structure, managers can be great sales coaches.\u00a0\u00a02. Malte ScholzCEO,\u00a0Airfocus\u00a0Being a manager often requires a very good understanding of the sales process so I don\u2019t see this as an issue. Coaching may be a bit challenging if they are used to doing things on their own, but this can be practiced.Sometimes specific business outcomes are not clearly defined so this impacts the coaching process because of the vagueness. However, when it comes to the skill itself, I believe managers can be excellent sales coaches.3. Joe Ingram\u00a0\u00a0CEO,\u00a0Ingram Interactive\u00a0Of course,\u00a0the safe answer is \u201cit depends on the manager\u201d but more often than not this myth is true.\u00a0\u00a0You can prove this to be true or make it false by reviewing 3 things-\u00a0The proven sales ability of the manager that is coaching.\u00a0\u00a0The training the manager has received on coaching and training.\u00a0\u00a0The Team they are coaching (the personality\u00a0make\u00a0up of most salespeople\u00a0prohibits\u00a0learning)\u00a0\u00a0Most sales managers are made a manager because they were good in sales.\u00a0 Their manager felt that if they gave this person a team of people then they could touch more prospects and then pass that expertise down to the sales team.\u00a0 In theory, that allows for production to stay steady while information is shared, and then production increases.\u00a0 This theory proves catastrophic in many situations.\u00a0 The reasons that it fails are as follows-Great sales people aren\u2019t always sure why they are great, they just know that they can get people to do things others\u00a0can\u2019t.\u00a0No one taught them how to teach or manage others\u00a0Most salespeople believe they know better even if their personal results aren\u2019t above average\u00a0Salespeople become \u201cdeaf\u201d to the constant coaching from their manager and can no longer hear what they are saying\u00a0Outside trainers that explain similar strategies to the ones being taught by the manager are the easiest ways to pass credibility and ultimately coaching effectiveness to the manager.\u00a04. David BittonCo-founder & CMO,\u00a0Doorloop\u00a0While these managers\u2019 tenure and selling abilities give them the legitimacy to train their team, they simply cannot due to a lack of availability and time.Most managers do not have the time to coach their teams adequately since many\u00a0deals\u00a0with multiple teams. Furthermore, most managers were promoted because they were excellent salespeople, but just because someone was a successful seller does not automatically make them a good sales coach.Coaching takes time, patience, and the proper technique, which doesn\u2019t come naturally to some people.\u00a05. Cliff AuerswaldPresident,\u00a0All Reverse Mortgage, Inc\u00a0Insinuating that managers can never make good sales coaches is a sweeping generalization that I\u2019ve rarely seen play out. In many cases, managers got to be managers because they were great salespeople. If you\u2019re struggling with a specific aspect of the sales funnel, I\u2019d definitely recommend going to your manager for some insight.\u00a06. Rahul Vij\u00a0CEO,\u00a0Webspero\u00a0No doubt, the external expert sales coaches have a good hand at the concepts and tutoring, but it is still an ordinary line of thinking. Managers, on the other hand, can have a bigger impact on salespeople. After all, they are more familiar with the needs of the organization and the performance of the sales team.\u00a0\u00a0Besides, the bottom performers can enjoy more room for improvement by having access to their\u00a0managers\u2019\u00a0guidance anytime they want.

And I\u2019m here to make your task easier by providing a checklist that you can refer to, so you can turn every call into an effective sales call.\u00a08\u00a0Simple steps to an effective sales call for every sales repIf you want to make a lasting impression on your prospect via sales call, then you need to implement these 8 steps in your calling strategy!1. Do thorough research workThe key to making an effective sales call is the research work and effort you put in before making the call. This step will direct you to the path of a\u00a0successful sales call and help you get started in a familiar manner.\u00a0Before getting on any sales call, ask yourself these questions \u2013\u00a0\u00a0What is your prospect\u2019s company about?\u00a0What are their pain points?\u00a0What are your prospect\u2019s pain points?\u00a0Their interests on various topics.\u00a0Who are their\u00a0competitors?\u00a0Studying these points will help you gain insights into your prospect\u2019s requirements so you can provide personalized so\u00a02. Prepare your agenda\u00a0Your value proposition is what will attract the prospect, so you need to ensure that it\u2019s solid and doesn\u2019t contain any errors. Be clear in what\u00a0you want to convey so\u00a0later on\u00a0there\u2019s no confusion between any parties.\u00a0\u00a0Before hopping on the call, you must know the key points that you need to discuss with the prospects,\u00a0any follow-up questions that you need to ask, or any resource supporting your claim.\u00a03. Qualify the prospect\u00a0For\u00a0converting\u00a0your prospect into a customer,\u00a0you can\u2019t simply jump to the presentation. You need to ask them certain questions\u00a0first\u00a0and find out whether you can qualify the prospect as your potential customer or not.\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, you need to find out these things before you convey your value proposition \u2013\u00a0\u00a0What\u2019s the process your prospect goes through before\u00a0making a decision?\u00a0How badly do they need your\u00a0product/service?\u00a0Does their allocated funds are at par with what they\u2019re asking?\u00a0What\u2019s their time frame?\u00a0Finding out the reason why they\u2019re\u00a0switching\u00a0to your company.\u00a0Asking these\u00a0simple questions will help you focus on the prospect and their needs and eliminate the guesswork.\u00a04. It\u2019s the presentation time\u00a0And here comes the\u00a0most important step in your sales call \u2013 the ultimate presentation! This is where you need to pay extra heed to the prospects and follow tips to make an impressive presentation. Ensure that your value proposition is succinct and to the point.\u00a0Since it\u2019s a phone call, you\u00a0have to\u00a0make sure that you stay true to the agenda, because\u00a0your prospect will only be hearing your voice, so I suggest that you avoid any sarcastic or witty remarks that you normally include when talking to the prospect\u00a0in person\u00a0as your tone may get misjudged.\u00a05. Handle objections and queries like a pro\u00a0This goes without saying; when you put forward your value proposition, there will be plenty of follow-up questions, and\u00a0sometimes\u00a0even objections to certain aspects of the proposition.\u00a0\u00a0This is where you need to prepare yourself and don\u2019t get tangled up; remain composed and provide an answer for every follow-up question. Moreover, if the prospect has any objections (because\u00a0a sales call doesn\u2019t always go right),\u00a0see that you ask which specific point they have an issue with\u00a0and whether you can help them resolve it.\u00a0For instance, if you have a CRM software with all the basic features, but your prospect wants a scheduler or live chatbox as well. In such scenarios, you can enlighten\u00a0your prospect about possible integrations that they can do to use your CRM software along with other features.\u00a06. Take notes\u00a0Taking notes during a sales call is highly crucial. What if you had a discussion with a prospect, they agreed to your value\u00a0proposition,\u00a0but they had some doubts and wanted to schedule another call?\u00a0In such a situation, if you have notes from the meeting, you can refer to them and come up with points that can help your prospect in decision-making. Moreover, if taking notes is too hectic during a call, you can also use the call recording feature so you can later listen to the entire conversation.\u00a07. Map out the next stage before ending the call\u00a0You and your prospect are on the same page, now what?\u00a0You need to take this further so you can get the prospect closer to the last stage of the sales process.\u00a0Now, what you can do is when you\u2019re about to end the call, you can provide them with options to take this deal to the next le"

The deal on the table is clear: I\u2019ll stop crying if you give me a treat. \u00a0That\u2019s sales in its most raw form, and we are all born with that skill hardwired into our DNA.\u00a0It would be most accurate to say that while everyone is born a salesperson, the diamonds that shine the brightest are the ones that take the time to learn how to polish themselves the best.\u00a02. Nathan HughesFrom Diggity Marketing, Marketing director\u00a0It\u2019s a complete myth and it can negatively affect a salesperson\u2019s career as well if they think that they were not born with the qualities of a salesperson.\u00a0Salespeople are made, just like in any other profession. It takes a lot of practice and one needs to harbor strong persuasive skills. In fact, if someone thinks that they were \u201cborn to sell\u201d, they might never improve their skills in their career.\u00a0Selling definitely comes with a lot of rejection and a salesperson needs to have thick skin to handle it well.\u00a03. Mark DaoustFrom QuietLight, CEO\u00a0I disagree with the idea that salespeople are born, not made. \u00a0The keys to a successful career in sales are confidence, interpersonal skills and an extensive knowledge of the product or service you are trying to sell.\u00a0Skills such as confidence and interpersonal skills come more naturally to some people then they do to others and some people have an easier time learning the ins and outs of a product. \u00a0However, that does not mean that a dedicated salesperson cannot develop these important skills with hard work and patience. In fact, salespeople who rely solely on their natural abilities without putting in the time to further develop these skills will often do worse in the long run than a salesperson who started out without these skills and had to develop them.\u00a0\u00a0In conclusion, I think a more accurate expression would be \u201cGood salespeople CAN be born, but great salespeople are MADE.\u201d4. Farzad Rashidi \u00a0From Respona, Co-Founder\u00a0Certainly not true. There is a lot of evidence to suggest that even the best salespeople are nurtured and trained to cultivate their skills.\u00a0Salesmanship isn\u2019t learned just from sitting in front of a computer screen for endless hours on end. We know this because research shows that practicing opportunity identification through counseling, mentoring, coaching, or training sessions with experienced professionals creates an increase in performance right away (within minutes).\u00a0This suggests that sales skills can be learned if we know the strategies and techniques for how to do it properly. In other words, there\u2019s nothing about \u201cbeing born with it.\u201d\u00a0Although, I can see why this myth emerged.\u00a0Some people are good at understanding and empathizing with other humans in the way that salespeople need to do.5. Grant AldrichFrom OnlineDegree, CEO\u00a0Great salespeople are in touch with themselves. They understand how to not only play to their strengths and avoid exposing their weaknesses, but they also do so in a real-time dialogue with other people. Knowing yourself and the other party is tricky work, but they\u2019ve worked at it so adeptly as a matter of self-improvement that it seems like they\u2019re a natural. \u00a0That\u2019s why we say they\u2019re born, not made, but even the best of the best had to work at it to get where they are.\u00a06. Jacob DayanFrom Communitytax, CEO\u00a0I believe that the saying salespeople are born, not made is a myth and not something to live by. I understand how there are people born with a personality that fits sales or business, but at the same time, there are many people who can learn sales skills and be at the top. \u00a0What makes a salesperson successful are their skills of confidence, listening, multi-tasking, and thinking"

And the appointment sales email is a direct approach to reach prospects.\u00a0\u00a0You can also experiment with different techniques to reach prospects through emails. When you are reaching out to the customer/prospect, you have to research on following points-\u00a0Where can you find potential prospect?When you have to reach the customer or prospect, you have to hunt for them firstly. You need to brainstorm and ask yourself where are the chances of meeting your prospects. Is it via LinkedIn or some group event, or through surveys or at some other social media page?\u00a0\u00a0You have to create the personas, and according to them, you can look out for potential prospects. Because having the potential prospect increases your chances of conversion. So, you need the right person to connect with.\u00a0Who is your potential prospect?\u00a0Yes, this is one of the most important aspects you need to invest your time in. You cannot sell paint colors to the ice cream vendor. So, you have to check their background.\u00a0Know about their industry, their expertise, their company size, and the age of the company. You can do this by conducting surveys, chats, or tracking their personas.\u00a0What is their issue?\u00a0After you have learned about the industry and the prospect\u2019s needs, the next thing is to provide them what they are looking for. Observe their concerns or brainstorm new ideas and put them across while meeting with the prospect.\u00a0This brings in the confidence in the prospect that you know them well, and they are more likely to trust you with it.\u00a0How can you provide a solution?\u00a0Now is the time that you can pitch your product. After listening to the concerns, you can smartly put up your product and discuss its features that will act as a solution to the prospect\u2019s issues.\u00a0When can you connect with them?Finally, this is what you have to basically ask in your email. Ask the prospect what is the convenient time they can connect with you. If possible, you can also share the time slots that are available with you. So that they can pick one and book it for themselves.\u00a0What are the key elements to include in the appointment sales email?Now we have talked about what to do before writing appointment sales email, now the thing is what we need to do while writing them.\u00a0For this, you can follow CRS method\u00a0C- Cause of Sending Mail\u00a0R- Request for Action\u00a0S- Sign Off Professionally\u00a0So basically, you have to structure your email in the format where \u2013\u00a0\u00a0You have to tell the reason why you are sending the email. What is the motive behind the same?\u00a0You have to ask the user to provide their contact information or ask them to click on the link and book slot. (If you have integrations like that).\u00a0Lastly, you have to end the message in a professional manner where you push them to book an appointment but at the same time not appear clingy.\u00a0The below example can give you idea of the CRS model\u00a0Hello XYZ,I am ABCD a"

            "content": "Warning! Reading ahead about the role of sales emails will change your perception and make you better at driving more sales via email.\u00a0Every business wants growth. And how does one grow? By narrowing down your customers and selling them your product. Sounds easy? In reality, it is not. Selling is an amalgamation of art and science. You need to know what your customers need to succeed.\u00a0But how can one sell? Traditionally when we think of sales, an image of a pushy salesperson comes to our head. And everybody avoids that salesman, whether it is someone who knocks on our doors or calls our phone. There are also those infamous emails that we receive. You know those emails that our brain automatically registers as scams or useless. The ones we delete ASAP. If nobody wants those emails, so why do companies keep sending them to us?\u00a0\u00a080% of people check their inbox at least once. Shockingly enough, checking the inbox multiple times makes us a part of that 11% who frequent their inboxes.\u00a0If the consumers spend time checking the emails, it becomes clear why companies send those sleazy emails. They are trying to monetize on a consumer\u2019s habits.\u00a0\u00a0Using emails to drive more sales\u00a0Would you rather talk to a friend or a salesperson over the phone? We assume it is the former. A friend listens to us, understands us, and is not trying to sell us anything (except maybe those who just started a business).\u00a0\u00a0However, great salespeople do not look like salespeople at all. Even though most of us are somehow irritated by those pushy salespeople, we all have experienced walking into a store and meeting a person who helped us make a better choice. That, too, was a salesperson. But instead of pushing us, they helped us. That is the difference between a salesperson and a great salesperson.\u00a0\u00a0And this is the difference you make as the said salesperson.\u00a0A good salesperson understands clients and their needs. Instead of forcing the clients into buying their product, they guide them to make a decision that helps them.\u00a0We can apply the analogy to our inboxes. We love receiving some emails. Emails that help us become a better person are most welcome.\u00a0\u00a0Unlike rumors and myths floating online, email marketing is not dead.\u00a0A study reported the return on investment can be up to 40x exceeding many channels. Subscribing to newsletters from our favorite brands and creators is almost like receiving a letter from a friend.\u00a0Emails that give us what we need at that moment bring us into purchasing the product/ service. That is the role of sales emails. Therefore, when you want to use emails to drive sales, it is vital to understand your customer and their needs.\u00a0Catering to their needs in a way that makes you a likable and trustworthy salesperson is the way to increase conversions. Moreover, emails allow you to receive feedback.\u00a0Another thing to keep in mind when using emails to increase sales is to maximize the touchpoints with your customer. IRC Sales Solutions states that businesses make only 2% of sales are when the point of contact is one. It means if you ignore to follow up, you lose 98% sales leads. That is a massive waste of your resources and efforts.\u00a0Instead of sending similar emails over and over again, choose to tailor a drip campaign. A drip campaign is a campaign that sends an email depending on the action of the user. The drip campaign can include cart abandonment, incomplete checkout, response to a lead magnet, etc.\u00a0Case study of a sales email campaign with an amazing ROI\u00a0Sometimes to sell your points better, it is better to illustrate a case study.\u00a0Let\u2019s take a look at David Huffman\u2019s sweet boost in open rates by 15-20% that he achieved with content-packed emails.\u00a0David is a content webmaster for Deaconess Health System in Evansville, Indiana. He used a smart technique to boost his open rates- he ran a 6-week email marketing test to see what happens next.\u00a0As salespeople, you may see emails as a way of connecting with prospects and sell your products/ services. However, a consumer highly values their inbox because that\u2019s where the communication happens on things they are most passionate about.\u00a0David and his team ran an A/B test split of a headline. Their goal was to re-engage cold leads and show them what they are missing with the help of brand-new content that put a high value on the right information that every consumer deserves to know.\u00a0David wanted these cold leads to enrolling in their program.\u00a0The metrics for the test was divided into two parts:\u00a0Primary: the number of people who enrolled into the program\u00a0Secondary: click-through rates, average open rates and unsubscribers\u00a0So how did they go through with it?\u00a0They sent one useful email to subscribers every week for six weeks. But, with a twist. They alternatingly sent non-gated emails (no form) and gated emails with a heavy call-to-action. And this is what it resulted in:\u00a0The conversion rate on gated content increased by 5%, and 40 leads reconverted.\u00a0The test generated 7 enrollments e"

            "content": "Anyone can write an email, even a school-going kid. It\u2019s easy to whip up a write-up and send it off without giving it a second thought, and the fact that we send and receive so many emails every day makes us think that not all individual emails hold much importance.\u00a0This mindset is not entirely wrong though if we think about it. I have written over hundreds of emails in my professional life, and even personally. But I would be wrong if I think that each of them made an impact on the reader as I wanted.\u00a0\u00a0After all, there are many like myself sending infinite numbers of emails every day.\u00a0The reason, you ask?\u00a0It\u2019s simple- not every email was written in a manner that would create the right impression on the readers.\u00a0Sales emails are no different. Buyers receive a number of emails every day, from one seller or the other. But how many sales emails do you think actually get opened?\u00a0The answer is 23.9%.So how do you make sure that your sales email not only gets opened but also read by your prospect? You do it by writing a compelling email that\u2019s hard to not notice.\u00a0Sales emails work as an envelope of invitation. You insert your company info, your offerings, and price and promotions in the email without coming out as sales-driven.\u00a0This communication tool has made its mark on the business community for being the most efficient revenue generation tool. So why not leverage it fully?\u00a0We are here to help you in crafting a compelling sales email that your readers would definitely click on and even wait to hear more from you! You can read more on how to craft effective sales emails here.\u00a0But first, let\u2019s go through the components that create an email.\u00a0The five components that give life to a sales emailJust like it takes several ingredients to make a yummy dish, similarly, it takes five key elements to make a sensible email that works. And in order to make it captivating, you need to learn how every component of the email should be crafted.\u00a0These essential elements need to be thoughtfully constructed around your goal, which is to capture and retain the attention of your prospects as they move through each stage of the sales process.\u00a0So, let\u2019s begin by understanding what these key components are and how they can be put together to design a perfect sales email.\u00a0\u00a01. Subject line\u00a0This is right where you get judged \u2013 at the very first glance!\u00a0Getting judged by someone is not what anyone would like, but then, you can use it to your own advantage. Write something that gets you judged right.\u00a0The number of emails sent daily is going to reach 347 billion by 2023. So that means your competition isn\u2019t getting slow anytime soon.\u00a0In such an aggressive digital environment, all you can do is survive by all means, which means you need to upgrade your game!\u00a0Are you writing subject lines like \u2013 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cHow can [company name] help you?\u201d\u00a0Or \u201cJust checking in.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Or worse, \u201cMeeting Request.\u201d\u00a0If your answer is yes, then stop doing it right away! These subject lines are killing your emails, and in turn making, you lose clients.\u00a0Instead, go for subject lines that say something to your readers and connects with them.\u00a0People today are incredibly busy, and they don\u2019t have time to go through every email they receive. This is why your subject lines are important. If you don\u2019t catch their attention, you don\u2019t get to sell.\u00a0Almost half of your recipients will open your email based on your subject line, which is why you better focus on your first impression.\u00a0\u201cI usually spend more time writing my email\u2019s subject line than I do on the email itself. If the subject line isn\u2019t great, no one will read the email anyway.\u201d- Brady Shearer\u00a0Here are some tips you can use while writing a sales email subject line that would guarantee clicks:\u00a0Write subject lines like a real person. Think what you\u2019d write as a subject line if you were writing to an acquaintance or a mutual connection. Nothing too familiar, but you need not be too complex either. Also, avoid making obvious mistakes, or let any email automation tool problem slip through, because nothing gets your sales email rejected more than the brackets showing the form field label, extra spacing, or a wrong name. You don\u2019t want to come off as someone who doesn\u2019t care.\u00a0Use catchy slogans only if you want to get your email deleted. You are writing a sales email, not a PR pitch, so know your reader before you craft the subject line to your sales email. Remember, you are not a copywriter to some big ad agency; you are a salesperson who wants to open a line of communication and nurture a relationship.\u00a0Never Capitalize Every Word of Your Subject Line, Like This. Your sales email is not a marketing broadcast that you sent you a million people. Sales emails work better when they are personalized, and that\u2019s the kind of first impression you really want to create with your subject line.\u00a0Pose a question in your subject line, as long as you ask the right questions. This is a great strategy to get more of your emails opened. You\u2019ll gradual"

            "content": "According to a study, sales emails that are sent in sequence with follow-ups increase their chances by 3 times to get a response back.\u00a0In sales and marketing, the first impressions are very significant, but they are not made at the first attempt. They are made with continuous efforts to reach out to the customer and earn their confidence enough to buy the product.\u00a0The emails sent to post the first attempt are named follow-up or check-in sales emails as they are used to keep check with the customer and establish the point of contact to the stage that escalates sales. Also, these sales emails are designed to keep customer loyalty and help the company win the clients for long term.\u00a0Now there might be different questions churning inside you about why, how, when, and to whom you have to send these check-in sales emails. No worries! We will look all and also share some winning templates at the end.\u00a0To whom we should send check-in sales emails?\u00a0The sales email could be sent to two broad categories of targeted audiences.\u00a0The Potential Clients- Sending check-in sales emails is a professional way to keep pitching your product or services in a subtle way that is an efficient way to grab your potential customer\u2019s attention.\u00a0The Existing Clients\u2013 Sending follow-up emails to your existing clients, also known as check-in emails, help you win the trust. They feel that you still care about them and would like to nurture this relationship and address their issue post-sales too.\u00a0Why we need to send check-in sales emails?\u00a0According to Smalbiztrendz.com, on average, 65% of customers perceive a negative impression of the company if there are no follow-ups sent to the customer. These emails help the company to nurture their relationship with the clients for longer run.\u00a0Also, apart from that here are solid six reasons why you should send follow-up sales emails.1. You get registered in the subconscious of  the user\u00a0When you keep sending the sales emails, you are constantly showing up in the user\u2019s mailbox. Whether they open the email or not, you still manage to get their eye.\u00a0This repetitive pattern and you appearing in the mailbox builds the brand name in the user\u2019s head and thus opens pliability of them connecting with you in the future.\u00a02. Your first email might have gone to spamMany mailboxes are set to send the unknown emails to the spam, and if the user has an overloaded mailbox, the new emails sometimes land up to the spam. So, your first email may get unnoticed.\u00a03. Following up helps in faster deal closure \u00a0The sale is not a one-day game; you need proper sales plan to pitch your product and close a deal. And the same implies when you shoot emails to your customers. The sales emails should be sent at calculative time intervals with a sequence. This portrays your professionalism and gives the client the impression that you know at which stage you are.\u00a04. Shows your concern\u00a0When you are constantly following a protocol or sequence of sales emails, it indicates to users that you are concerned about their issues and hence, providing a solution. You can simply send the sales email in the first pronoun or by addressing them with their first or last name. It makes the email more interactive and personal which leads to a higher scope of replying.\u00a05. Wrong timing\u00a0Sending the follow-up sales email is the backup for the bullseye you might have missed by sending the first email at the wrong time. Yes, there are wrong timings like sending in non-peak season or sending at late hours where the open rate of the email is low. So, a follow-up email is basically a second chance to get in the notice of your subscriber if you missed it the first time.6. First sales email did not contain an attractive subject lineThe opening rate of any email highly depends on what they see as a subject line. If your subject line is not fancy enough, the responses will be relatively lower. So, in case you made a mistake to send a sales email with a \u201cnot-so-attractive subject line\u201d, you can redeem your chance in the follow-up email. You can also use different trips and tricks to write an effective email for a quick response.\u00a0\u00a0When is the right time to send a check-in sales email?\u00a0Well, the first email is sent, and now the big question is when to send the other email and start shooting follow-up sales emails. Well, this could quite be tricky as you are working remotely. Not seeing your client face to face may lead to some mistakes made by your sales rep.\u00a0\u00a0So, schedule your check-in sales email when-\u00a0You have not gotten a reply to the first email within a week.\u00a0The first call or contact was established but no response came.\u00a0The appointment was made for a demo but the client did not show up.\u00a0The deal is closed verbally but payment has not been initiated.There is a new feature update of the product.\u00a0Discounts are being offered.\u00a0You have referral schemes for existing customers.\u00a0The issue was raised by the client and you resolved it.\u00a0*It is up to the management of the co"

When you can\u2019t get a reply from a prospect even after multiple follow-up emails, it\u2019s time to acknowledge the fact that the prospect might not be interested anymore.\u00a0Below are some reasons why a prospect gives cold treatment and stops communication.\u00a0They\u2019re not interested in your proposition.\u00a0They have found a better alternative.\u00a0\u00a0Prospect might not have opened the previous emails. (You can easily track email opens and clicks to find out whether the emails were read or not.)\u00a0The prospect didn\u2019t find your services up to the mark.\u00a0So, whenever you\u2019re in such a situation, it\u2019s better to lose contact rather than keep waiting on the impossible.

Therefore, keep the email short and get to the point.\u00a0Hello [First Name],I haven\u2019t heard back from you in a while. I apologize if my previous attempt to communication came off as persistent.If you\u2019re still interested in discussing the possibilities of working together to resolve your [pain points], I am available to assist you.If not, I will no longer contact you from here on.Regards,Your signature.While this email ends all the contacts between you and your prospect, it also keeps one window open where the prospect can reach out to you if they require further assistance.\u00a0Breakup email #2 \u2013 Seeking permission to close the fileWhenever a new prospect enters the sales pipeline, a file with their contact details and requirements is made to help them in the best way possible. So, when a prospect is no longer replying, the right thing to do is close the file and move on.\u00a0Hi [First Name],Since I haven\u2019t received any revert to my previous email, I want to inform you that we\u2019ll be closing your file. So, from now, you won\u2019t be getting any emails from [your company].If you wish to associate with us, kindly revert to this email so we can work on resolving your [pain points]. If not, we wish you all the best.Cheers,Your signature.This short email is highly effective as it not only ends the communication, but also erases all the data you have of that prospect, thus enticing them to respond if they\u2019re interested in your product or services.\u00a0Breakup email #3 \u2013 Close the loopDid you have promising conversations with several prospects only for them to disappear on you?

Now, this gives you an opportunity to capture and convert more leads by mastering the art of perfect cold outreach emails!\u00a0\nWhat is cold outreach email?\u00a0\nWhen we talk about the marketing strategies of salespeople and marketers, two terms come to mind \u2013 inbound marketing and outbound marketing. Inbound marketing is where the prospects make the first move and reach out to the company.\u00a0\nOutbound marketing, on the other hand, is a traditional form of marketing that includes reaching to prospects via door-to-door selling, cold calls, advertisements and cold emails.\u00a0\nTherefore, the emails with which we reach out to prospects in an email outreach campaign can be termed as \u2013 cold outreach emails.\nYou can execute a cold email strategy by building a list of potential clients and send them emails to grow your B2B network and capture more clients.Or, you can let professional blogger outreach services do the heavy lifting for you and enjoy the perks.\u00a0\nSteps for writing the perfect cold outreach email\u00a0\nAs the cold email will be your company\u2019s first impression, it\u2019s essential to craft an effective email that\u2019ll work in your favor.

The decision of opening an email or whether or not to mark it as spam depends on the subject line, so it needs to be meaningful and to the point.\u00a0\n\n\nYour subject line needs to be crisp, informative, relevant, and personalized. There are many variations when it comes to crafting a subject line, so you can test it out by performing A/B tests and find out which one is working best for your campaign.\u00a0\u00a0\nLastly, ensure that your subject line is optimized for mobile users, so the message doesn\u2019t get truncated.\u00a0\n\nPersonalize the email \u2013 If you personalize your email content, you\u2019re more likely to build a connection with your prospect.

            "title": "10 of the Most Effective Customer Retention Strategies",
            "content": "You\u2019ve implemented tactics to grow your business and increase the sales of your products and services. But that is only one side of the coin. The other side is customer retention.After you\u2019ve come up with a new product and identified your target audience, you are all set to start the business. But it is equally important to invest in resources to retain your existing customers. That is why you need to have a dedicated customer success team whose main job is to convince customers to stay.But retaining customers involves much more than just attending to your customers\u2019 calls. The customer manager should focus on developing relationships with your customers. The relationships should nurture trust and promote communication. Also, it is more cost-effective to retain existing customers than to invest in gaining new customers.According to\u00a0McKinsey Research, 87% of consumers shop around instead of remaining loyal to one brand. This makes it crucial for companies to try to retain their customers. But with the need to satisfy other demands, your company might face challenges in developing effective retention strategies.This guide will help you discover some of the most effective ways to retain your customers:1. Provide Exceptional Customer ServiceWho do you think loyal customers are? They are the happy and satisfied customers who have experienced excellent customer service. But it can be very difficult for your business to maintain the right balance between your business goals and customer services.Start and end your customer service communications with a simple \u201cthank you.\u201d This is the easiest and simplest way to provide exceptional customer service. Saying \u201cthank you\u201d at the beginning of the interaction shows that you are thankful that customers have selected your business. And saying it at the end of conversation leaves a positive impression of your business.Leveraging social media can also help you deliver effective customer service. Social media platforms allow you to connect with your customers on a personal level. Your customers from any part of the world, can like, share, and/or comment about your services or products on social media. If you are still not leveraging it, it is high time to use social media to enhance the experience you\u2019re giving your customers.For example,\u00a0Starbucks\u00a0leverages social media, and is known for their quick responses. They provide an exceptional customer service through different social platforms.On their\u00a0Twitter account, customers can ask about any ongoing contests or questions about stores. And Starbucks makes sure they reply to their customers quickly, and you can see in the screenshot below.2. Make the Most of Social ProofSocial proof is powerful and impactful on customers. More than\u00a090%\u00a0of people have reported having been impacted by online reviews of a product. Customers trust product reviews more than the sales copy of the product or the product description. They trust the words of peers, family, or friends more than the company itself.You can display user-generated content such as customer reviews, pictures or videos from various social media channels. You can aggregate this content and turn it into an organized compilation in the form of an Instagram wall and display it on digital screens in your store. This is a great tactic to give your customers something to rely on. And having genuine social proof is the best way to do the same.So social proof can help you win over a new audience. But it also plays a role in customer retention. Because when you talk about them, or share their stories, your existing customers will feel appreciated. They may be willing to stick around because your company has taken the time to notice and appreciate them. There are many types of social proof which you can use for retaining customers.Let\u2019s take a look at some of the most powerful ones, and how to use them effectively:Display User-Submitted Photos from Social Media on Product PagesYou can make customers feel special when they decide to share photos of your products on social media. Ask for their permission to share these photos on your product pages. This not only acts as social proof to win over new customers, but it also makes your existing customers feel acknowledged. This can go a long way in earning their loyalty.For example,\u00a0BlackMilk\u00a0is a fashion and clothing website. For each of their products, they assign a specific hashtagThey encourage customers to use this hashtag to get featured on their product page. This is how the company leverages user-generated photos to gain customers trust and retain their existing customers.Share Customer Stories Through VideosBy highlighting customers\u2019 stories in videos, you can showcase the way your company communicates and collaborates with customers. Make sure you showcase the results you have achieved for your customers, and how you have helped solve their issues.Customer story videos provide long-term social proof and can create a huge impact on pr"

            "content": "When a sales representative is selling a product with the customer\u2019s purchase in mind, they are only focusing on the product. Their focus, however, should be on the customer. If a company wants to sell products, they must think like a buyer rather than a seller.That\u2019s because a seller\u2019s mindset is only limited to increasing product sales and achieving their sales targets. But to grow your business, your sales representatives must think like a customer and imagine the journey the customer takes when making a purchase.Customer journey mapping is vital for the sake of getting an overall understanding of the buying behavior of a customer. Your company must be aware and familiar with a customer\u2019s journey so you can quickly and easily resolve any issues the customer might face along the way.Your company must have a detailed understanding of how a potential buyer is reacting at each touchpoint. This will help you build an effective and efficient customer experience strategy.Millward Brown Digital surveyed 300+ US senior marketing professionals from various companies. The survey revealed that a buyer\u2019s behavior tends to shift. Due to which companies are facing problems keeping track of it. At least 55% of marketers reported having no confidence in their understanding a buyer\u2019s journey.What is the reason for this? Are companies not efficiently conducting customer mapping? Or is it just that their customers are moving too fast that it\u2019s a challenge to keep an eye on them?If you have questions like these, and are looking for answers, this post is for you. This post will talk about the advantages of efficient customer mapping. It will also guide you through how to build an effective customer journey mapAdvantages of Customer Journey MappingCustomer journey mapping can help marketers think like a customer and see their business from a customer\u2019s point of view. It helps businesses understand the pain points of their customers. This, in turn, will help them discover ways to improve their customer experience. Also, marketers will be able to figure out what it takes for a potential customer to make a purchase.Customers prefer a seamless experience with brands. And businesses can enhance the customer\u2019s experiences with an efficient customer journey map in place. Let\u2019s talk about the advantages of customer journey map more thoroughly.1. Boosts ROIThrough a customer journey map, a business can better understand the behavior and intent of the customer. This gives businesses the opportunity to utilize data and leverage it. It allows businesses to target and approach customers on a more personal level with personalized marketing messages.When businesses interact with customers through personalized messages, customers react to these interactions. And they can potentially become brand ambassadors for your company, recommending you to their family and friends. This will generate positive feedback and effective ROI, as the money spent on developing your message doesn\u2019t go to waste.2. Speeds Up Sales CyclesAnother main benefit of customer journey mapping is that you can improve your sales cycle. Providing your customer with a flawless experience should be your top priority across every channel. Companies can get their sales cycle up and running by optimizing each channel. Also, it ensures that every department is on the same page regarding customer engagement.When every department is working together, it helps make sure that the customer will not experience any issues at the various touchpoints. Or, even if they do, this helps ensure that issues are quickly resolved. This allows the customer to receive the correct information and move smoothly forward in the sales cycle.3. Combines Customer Data and Increases EngagementBusiness may have to deal with inefficient data management, as departments work in silos. Through customer journey mapping, businesses can combine all data and then develop an overall and complete perception of customer interactions.This also gives you the opportunity to develop a comprehensive profile of customers derived from the engagement on different channels. The collected data can be used to maintain continuous engagement with the customer, even after the purchase. It can be used to upsell and cross-sell relevant services and products to your customers.4. Helps to Identify Gaps in Customer ServiceCustomer journey maps will also help you to successfully identify any gaps in your present customer services or communication. Let\u2019s say your business has developed a mobile-friendly website, but the version is not working properly. Through the map, you can find out if the mobile version is well-optimized or not.The map can also reflect if there is any communication problems within your employees. Perhaps your customer service agents are not getting support from their colleagues during their communication with customers. These kinds of issues require immediate attention during the customer journey. And the mapping of cus"

            "content": "Knowing what not to do, is as important as unearthing those secrets to success. Sometimes we tend to go on selling the same way, avoiding the flaws that are not taking us to our destination. As the adage goes \u201cwhat is the use of running if you are not on the right road?\u201d For staying on the right track, you need smart tactics and effective sales strategies.Sales strategy is a thoughtful activity that helps businesses in ameliorating their sales. It acquaints you with your problem areas and shows you the route you need to take for achieving the desired outcome. The right sales strategies can support your sales efforts and ease your journey to reach your sales goals quickly.With the evolution of technology and rise of business players in the industry, each year you will see a new sales strategy stepping into the field of sales. However, some sales strategies have been in this field since ages and worked for many companies.Proven sales strategies from top entrepreneurs and startupsHere are few of the sales strategies implemented by successful entrepreneurs and sales experts that can even help you in achieving your desired sales numbers:1. Set specific goalsIn sales, you need to have a bullseye to target, or else you will wander in the wilderness. Just saying my objective is to \u201cincrease sales\u201d is not enough. You need to\u00a0define this goal more clearly. It is not possible to track the progress of such vague goals. Without evaluating the progress, you won\u2019t know if the effort you are putting, is reaping fruitful results or not.As\u00a0John Doerr, president at RAIN Group\u00a0writes\u201d\u00a0Salespeople who live by goals- Know where they\u2019re headed\u201dHe further says\u00a0\u201cIf you\u2019re searching for your destination, contrary to what you might read in others\u2019 writings about goals, you don\u2019t have to sort out your entire life purpose in order to achieve in sales. All you need to do is set a target for yourself \u2013 that can be as simple as an annual sales target \u2013 and to have a good answer for the question, \u201cDoes my entire being scream with a desire to achieve this goal? Will I be in agony and turmoil until I do?If the answer is yes, then you\u2019re in great shape to get started. (Perhaps you don\u2019t need all the angst and agony, but salespeople who are not dissatisfied with where they are don\u2019t often make it to the next level).\u201dWhen you have a specific goal, you will know where exactly you want to go and what you need to. This is one of the most effective sales strategies that can increase your sales. Don\u2019t be hasty with your goals; think, strategize and then create a goal.For example, instead of saying that we want to increase our business revenue, be more specific that our business goal is to achieve $100000 by 31st, December. Let\u2019s assume the average deal size is $50,000, so you will have to close 20 deals until 31st December to achieve your goal.Such clear goals give you direction and help you in staying focused. They are measurable, so you can evaluate their progress to understand how far are you from your goals and what more you need to do to reach there. You can use a startup CRM to gain access to your sales data and create better strategies based on data instead of assumptions.Get your sales organized with SalesmateFeature rich and best suited CRM for small businessesTry FREE for 15 days2. Analyzing past salesYour historical sales records are a useful source of vital information that you shouldn\u2019t ignore while setting your goals. Using various\u00a0reporting tools, you can easily analyze your past sales and determine the areas of improvement.\u201cAt Metal Mafia, I start the goal-setting process by looking at the company\u2019s overall business from the year before. First, I check the increase of total sales over the prior year and account for where it came from month by month. Did I add a sales rep in a certain month? Did I change the number of trade show or industry appearances in a specific season?Examining last year\u2019s goals and results is equally important for setting realistic and achievable goals. Evaluate the previous year\u2019s goals and understand if you had achieved them or not. If not, then dig into reasons and find out what went wrong. This will help in building strategies for performing better in the future.3. Commence by targeting small marketsTargeting different business verticals and the market might seem appealing. Wider the market better the reach. Isn\u2019t it? Well, this doesn\u2019t always work. Having a finger in every pie, adds to the complications. When you target a wider market, it becomes difficult to understand and address their business challenges.As\u00a0Steve Davis, Principal and Founder of The CXO Advisory Group\u00a0writes\u00a0\u201cThe other problem that companies have is they focus on too big of a market. They focus on the whole universe. Business schools simply will say you might want to pick best market with the biggest market segment that you can go after. In many cases, that\u2019s wrong \u2013 the bigger market segments typically have the most competitors in it. Wh"

You can send personalized and highly-targeted emails to your subscribers at specific intervals to stay connected.Moreover, email automation can also be used to send emails as a response to the user\u2019s activity. For instance, a payment confirmation email is sent(action) when the user completes the transaction(trigger).The above pie chart reflects how more and more businesses are now implementing email automation software.How does email automation work?Email automation allows marketers to create automated email workflows for every email marketing campaign. In these automated workflows, you can add actions, events, and conditions so that when a condition is met and action is completed, the email gets triggered.Here are the most common email automation triggers that are used by marketers and salespeople \u2013\u00a0\nWelcome emailPageview or product viewAbandoned cartPost-purchaseSubscription expirationUpsell/Cross-sell\u00a0Milestone achievementBased on these triggers, you can create automated emails for your marketing, sales, or customer service process.6 Benefits of email automation\u201cEmail has an ability many channels don\u2019t: creating valuable, personal touches- at scale.\u201d \u2013 David Newman\u00a0Businesses are busy tasks, and most of them eat all your precious time. One of the most tiring yet crucial tasks is to send emails.\u00a0Creating an email list and drafting each email for hundreds of your customers manually\u00a0can take ages.And even if somehow you decide to do it all on your own, you won\u2019t be able to deliver them on time, and you are bound to make mistakes.\u00a0\u00a0For every dollar spent on email marketing, ROI can reportedly reach\u00a0$44.\u00a0 Moreover, automated emails have comparatively higher click rates as well.Here is how\u00a0Email automation\u00a0comes into play-\u00a0you can do it all right on time while saving your precious hours as well as energy.\u00a0\u00a0But this is not all;\u00a0let\u2019s see how else your business can be benefited with email automation.\u00a01.

Their requirement might have changed in recent time, and this is the point where you need to connect with them. You can get them to engage again with your business by adding them to your mailing list and bringing them back on board.Re-engagement can be highly effective if you do it the right way. In the below graph, five types of re-engagement campaigns have been surveyed, and the results are completely unbelievable!You can create a list of all those customers who haven\u2019t been active in maybe, two or three months, or even six months, depending on what works best for you, and craft compelling emails that make them check out your new offers.2. Deliver\u00a0the\u00a0right information\u00a0to the right people\u00a0Email automation allows you to create workflows for every action that a customer performs and sends emails based on those triggers. These automated emails are specially customized for each trigger.For example, if you want to greet a new customer who recently signed up as a trial user, you can automatically send a welcome email. Thereafter, the automation will start working based on the subscriber\u2019s actions.This increases the relevancy of your emails, which is important to retain your customers.

            "title": "All you need to know about sales incentives",
            "content": "Sales isn\u2019t the same as it used to be. The times have changed, and so has technology. And with this change in technology, advancements in sales methodologies have also taken place.\u00a0For example, the way salespeople used to interact with customers has changed drastically over the past decade, thanks to the introduction of new calling methods and emails.\u00a0\u00a0Similarly, many other practices in sales have changed with the changing world around.\u00a0One such practice is that of providing sales incentives to the salespeople.\u00a0What are sales incentives?\u00a0\u201cCall it what you will, incentives are what get people to work harder.\u201d \u2013 Nikita Khrushchev\u00a0A sales incentive is a reward/compensation (cash or non-cash) that\u2019s given to a salesperson for performing up to a level, mainly for selling a particular amount of goods or services.\u00a0In simple terms, sales incentives are something that motivates your team to wake up in the morning and get to work.\u00a0Motivation is not something that is easily found by all. It\u2019s the matter of personal choices and the matter at hand that makes a person decide whether he\u2019s interested in that work or not. However, sometimes, extrinsic motivation can be provided to the person for him to complete a task.\u00a0Sales incentives are such advantages given in exchange for the work done while boosting the morale of your sales team higher.\u00a0According to a study by Incentive Research Foundation, it is found that incentive programs can boost performance by up to 44% if built correctly.\u00a0Let\u2019s look into what type of sales incentives can be provided to your sales reps to grow their performance.\u00a0Types of sales incentives\u00a0There are various multifaceted compensation options available to provide to the team and several factors that must be considered while creating a sales incentive program of your own.\u00a0\u00a0Here are the five types of sales incentives that can become the building blocks of your sales incentive scheme.\u00a01. Role-specific incentives\u00a0Just like there are various sales methodologies that help the sales reps navigate through the sales process similarly, your sales incentive program should be helping reps to perform to their core strengths.\u00a0\u00a0The best way to do this is to plan an incentive program based on the rep\u2019s capabilities.\u00a0For example, let\u2019s say you are selling a \u201cproduct.\u201d Now, it may not be a physical product but a service that requires an ongoing relationship with the customers even after the deal is closed. Whether the service is cloud-based software or a mobile app, additional expertise is always required to assist the frontline salespeople in their sales process.\u00a0\u00a0For instance, you want a specialist seller who can help with complex sales and solution architects to aid the sellers with the know-how of the digital or otherwise intricate products.\u00a0Other roles that you\u2019d like to consider in this case would be customer-care experts for attentive aftersales support and advisory salespeople who have a thorough knowledge of the industry and can provide presale guidance to the customers on what type of solution to buy.\u00a0Once all necessary roles are identified for every step of the sales process, you need to decide on a specific goal for each of them to fulfill. However, you need to keep in mind that since every employee has a different role to play, their behavior and goals will be different.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This means that the importance and intensity of each role would not be alike either. Hence, coming up with a different incentive plan for each role is necessary so as to avoid any conflicts or internal competition between the employees.\u00a0This is how a role-specific incentive plan works.\u00a02. Split incentives\u00a0Sales processes can sometimes be complex than the others, and so they may require two or more reps working on the same team simultaneously. This team-up is decided according to their roles.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Let\u2019s say your company sells a SaaS product that rolls out new features now and then. These features are all technical in nature and not always easy for the salesperson to understand.\u00a0Hence, you introduce a specialized product manager in your sales team to help out your sales reps with the complexities of the new features. This product manager will assist the sales rep with in-depth explanations of the product\u2019s new capabilities.\u00a0Now, two stakeholders get involved in such a case- the sales rep and the product manager. So, how do you decide on incentivizing both of them?\u00a0The answer is a split incentive program.\u00a0This method encourages your reps to work together and collaborate on their efforts. The incentives are either split down to the middle or are in pre-decided proportions. However, you need to keep the proportions clarified beforehand to reduce the tension between the reps and promote fairness.\u00a03. Pre-sales incentives\u00a0We cannot say this enough \u2013 today\u2019s sales is more complex than ever. With a plethora of options available in the market, and every company reaching out with detailed marketing programs, customers are subjected to endless confus"

In fact, the mixed information out there about email marketing and marketing automation on the web doesn\u2019t make it easy for a company that wants to implement either of the options.Well, we know that these tools are here to help streamline your marketing process, but how exactly that\u2019ll help your company? Let me break it down for you \u2013\u00a0\u00a0Help you convert MQLs and SQLs into customers\u00a0Staying connected with your customers at every touchpoint\u00a0Communicating at the right time to increase the response rate\u00a0Track performance to build stronger strategies\u00a0Today, I\u2019m going to shed light on the core difference between email marketing and marketing automation. Yes, both approaches are still prevalent and are helping businesses grow.\u00a0But,\u00a0which one is the right fit for your business?\u00a0\u00a0Well, you\u2019ll only find out after you bifurcate these two. So, let\u2019s first glance at these two marketing strategies individually so we can later compare them.\u00a0What is email marketing?\u00a0Email marketing is one of the most effective channels for promoting your business to your prospects and customers. In fact, it goes beyond the marketing perspective; you can connect with your users, engage with meaningful content and build strong relationships.\u00a0\u00a0Email marketing enables you to inform your users about the company updates, any upcoming offers or\u00a0run promotional campaigns to constantly engage with TOFT and bring them down the sales funnel.\u00a0Email marketing has existed for as long as we can remember, and even now, it\u2019s one of the most used communication channels between a company and its customers. Nearly\u00a09 out of 10\u00a0marketers use email marketing to distribute content organically. Therefore, you can only imagine what impact email marketing has on a company that uses it compared to the one that doesn\u2019t.\u00a0What is marketing automation?\u00a0Marketing automation is an approach that revolves around building connections with prospects and customers by delivering personalized user experiences and understanding their preferences.\u00a0Here\u2019s how marketing automation helps every business grow \u2013\u00a0\u00a0The majority of marketers\u2019 productivity is affected due to repetitive manual tasks. With marketing automation, 95% of the salespeople said they are getting more time for other essential tasks while automation does their manual activities.\u00a093% of marketers also shared that their workload has been reduced by a considerable amount as they\u2019re now able to automate multiple tasks.\u00a0With a streamlined automation process for marketing campaigns, work feels easier for 93% of the marketers.\u00a091% of salespeople found that they\u2019re getting more time for the planning stage so they can execute better marketing campaigns in the future.\u00a0You can only stay productive when you enjoy your work, and with automation, 87% of marketers feel that the work has become more enjoyable.\u00a0Marketing automation takes away all your hassle of manual work by automating the entire marketing process. From connecting with customers to executing campaigns and scheduling meetings, marketing automation streamlines the work process with a series of trigger-based actions that go off when a condition is met.\u00a0For instance, you can set-up automation for every time a prospect sign up.

Whether it\u2019s email marketing tool or marketing automation, you need to consider the price and whether it\u2019s value for money.\u00a0If you\u2019re a small enterprise, you need a marketing tool that\u2019s affordable and scalable, so when your business starts growing, it can scale with the growth, and you don\u2019t incur any extra charges. While you\u2019re checking the prices, you should also look at the add-on plans, if any, to ensure you get what you\u2019re paying for.Intelligence and analytics\u00a0A good marketing tool consists of smart analytics to measure performance. Both email marketing and marketing automation possess many variations, depending on the tool and its features.\u00a0So,\u00a0you need to ensure that the one you have your eye on is smart enough to make your work life easier, not the other way around.

            "content": "Business is all about evolution. The minute a business owner decides to step down from direct selling and\u00a0starts the maturation process of his organization, his business\u00a0evolves into a high-speed sales machine.\u00a0After reaching\u00a0a\u00a0certain\u00a0Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR), most of the companies can be found in one of the two buckets- either they would be thriving and marching ahead with the same force, or they would be\u00a0falling apart, unable to continue their growth.\u00a0You can already figure out what happens to the companies with their sales teams knocking it all off- their\u00a0customer\u00a0acquisition increases, and they keep delivering consistent results as they continue to execute linear sales strategies and tactics\u00a0throughout their sales process.\u00a0On the other hand, those companies that find it difficult to float beyond this juncture have several cracks in their foundation.\u00a0These teams met an early success without having a proper process to attribute this\u00a0success to.\u00a0Often, their revenue generation\u00a0owned\u00a0to\u00a0sheer\u00a0hard work of the CEO and few of the early\u00a0team members\u00a0who\u00a0happened to be\u00a0accidently good at sales.\u00a0In order to stay on the path\u00a0of\u00a0linear growth, a company has to focus\u00a0on the growth of its sales team as well.\u00a0I\u00a0have heard many business owners talking about their declining sales\u00a0by\u00a0using vague phases like:\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know why we are such a mess\u2026\u201d\u00a0\u201cWe never\u00a0get to\u00a0know how many deals would be closed\u00a0for sure,\u00a0so we\u00a0are\u00a0never\u00a0able to\u00a0forecast our sales\u201d\u00a0\u201cI am terrible at hiring and somehow I never pick the right people\u201d\u00a0Sales surely is chaotic and unpredictable. But\u00a0it\u00a0doesn\u2019t have to stay that way forever!\u00a0\u201cWe cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.\u201d- Albert Einstein\u00a0Every company goes through a process of maturation, where its individual sales reps gradually grow into a team and eventually, in an organization.\u00a0To understand this process better,\u00a0I\u00a0have\u00a0come up with\u00a0an interesting way to get it straightened out-\u00a0The Avengers Analogy\u00a0Many similarities can be seen between the growth of a\u00a0business\u00a0and that of\u00a0The\u00a0Avengers Initiative,\u00a0materialized\u00a0by\u00a0Nick Fury, an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.\u00a0Let\u2019s see how you can learn about the maturity of your business and sales team with the help of this analogy.\u00a0Stage #1 Commencement of\u00a0S.H.I.E.L.D\u00a0When a business first opens its doors, the CEO or the proprietor does all the selling. He\u2019s the sole rainmaker,\u00a0just like\u00a0Nick Fury.\u00a0Fury had but one goal in mind- to save the world from the external threats.\u00a0The owner of the business, similarly, has\u00a0a\u00a0goal of\u00a0driving more sales and\u00a0growing the\u00a0revenue\u00a0of his business.\u00a0However, could Nick Fury do it all alone?\u00a0I\u00a0don\u2019t think so.\u00a0That\u2019s where comes the next stage, where the Nick Fury of every business realizes that he doesn\u2019t have to do it all alone. This is where a team comes into play\u2026\u00a0Stage #2\u00a0Enters the Heroes\u2026\u00a0S.H.I.E.L.D was in need of\u00a0powerful\u00a0heroes who could save Earth from threats that came from\u00a0the worlds\u00a0far away. And\u00a0my friend\u00a0Nick knew\u00a0exactly the right people for the job. His choice? Steve Rogers, Tony Stark,\u00a0Clint\u00a0Barton, Natasha\u00a0Romanoff, and Bruce Banner.\u00a0While Fury knew\u00a0who\u00a0would be the best fit\u00a0for the job, it was easy for him to locate and hire\u00a0them. But not you.\u00a0You as a\u00a0business owner know what kind of candidate would match\u00a0your\u00a0criteria, but looking for one is always a task. Thus,\u00a0having a reliable and repeatable hiring process is what saves\u00a0you\u00a0from\u00a0your\u00a0doom.\u00a0Recruiting the right sales people becomes an essential process in growing a business. This is\u00a0how\u00a0the business first starts to mature.\u00a0Stage #3 Heroes become Avengers\u00a0Let\u2019s go back in time, when Steve Rogers became Captain America- The\u00a0First Avenger. He had a good heart, hard-working attitude, and a knack for learning. But he didn\u2019t have\u00a0a\u00a0sense of\u00a0purpose.\u00a0A newly hired\u00a0sales rep is\u00a0pretty much similar to the\u00a0captain. He can work hard, give his all into his work, but\u00a0is\u00a0unaware of the goals set by the company, which ultimately becomes his\u00a0target.\u00a0Captain America finally found his purpose when he met Nick Fury and joined his initiative.\u00a0In time, one sales rep becomes two, two becomes four, and so on\u2026and there you have it! A Sales\u00a0department\u00a0is created!\u00a0During this stage, sales reps function as lone rangers, with their own agendas to fulfill, their own goals to reach. There\u2019s not much communication between the salespeople and their results are all over the place. Some succeed while others fail when they work in a\u00a0Sales\u00a0Department.\u00a0Stage #4\u00a0The\u00a0Civil War\u00a0Since every Avenger has their own agenda, there\u2019s ought to be a clash amongst\u00a0them. Remember what happened\u00a0after The Avengers defeated Ultron? The entire team\u00a0clashed\u00a0due to\u00a0friction between Iron Man and Captain America.\u00a0Why do you think it happened? It was because they never worked on the same page from the beginning. With their own targets and intentions, none of the\u00a0Avenger was ever ready to understand someone else\u2019s\u00a0view, which\u00a0led to a Civil War.\u00a0The\u00a0same situation\u00a0often\u00a0ar"

Just taking a step back by saying the \u2018price is too high\u2019 won\u2019t help in sales.\u00a0\u00a0People are even ready to purchase an expensive product if they find it beneficial.\u00a0\u00a0So focus on the benefits of your product; for that, it is important to understand the potential prospect\u2019s needs and challenges.\u00a0\u00a0Once you discover the prospect\u2019s business pain points and requirements, you just need to make them visualize how your product can help them.\u00a0\u00a0Use case studies to show them how you helped a business overcome a similar issue. Sales is all about gaining trust and persuading the prospect by communicating the value of your product. If you manage to do both of them, you can easily sell high-priced products.\u00a0\u201cThe prospects aren\u2019t responding\u201d\u00a0\u00a044% of sales reps give up after one follow-up\u00a0\u00a0The deals won\u2019t move ahead in the sales pipeline without consistent follow-up.

Besides, you can automate your text messages using the modern sales tool. Most of the modern CRM allows you to create\u00a0sequences\u00a0of emails or texts to put your follow-up on autopilot.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThe sales targets\u00a0 are unrealistic\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Sales managers often ponder over various factors before setting the targets. Do not question their decision if even one member of the team is able to achieve the same target.\u00a0\u00a0If the top sales performer can achieve the target, that just implies it isn\u2019t unrealistic. All it requires is a little hard word.\u00a0\u00a0So change your sales approach and walk the extra mile to achieve your target. Track your sales performance. Create a sales report and identify your performance gap. Put in more effort and try to work on the improvement areas.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThe competitors are stronger\u201dPepsi wouldn\u2019t have been so popular if it had said there is already a strong brand like Coca-Cola in the market.\u00a0\u00a0There are alternatives for each product. But that doesn\u2019t mean your product is weak or nobody would purchase it.\u00a0It depends on how you sell the product. There are chances that your competitors might have better features, but their product might be more expensive than yours.\u00a0You need to explain this to your prospective buyer. Show them the brighter side. There are even chances that your product may have fewer features, but those features might be enough to overcome your target audience\u2019s issues.

            "content": "Thanks to the marketing team, your sales pipeline is filled with enough deals to fulfill your quota.\u00a0\u00a0However, despite having a pipeline filled with deals, are you able to meet your sales quota?\u00a0Sadly, most of the deals do not convert into sales. Many are stuck in the pipeline, and some slip through the crack.\u00a0Well, why does this happen?Why do deals get stuck in the sales pipeline?How to move them and convert the deals into sales quickly?\u00a0Well, read on to find answers to these questions.Why do deals get stuck?\u00a0\u00a0A sales pipeline with deals stuck at various stages is the most unpleasant sight for a sales professional. It just means that the deals aren\u2019t progressing towards sales.There are many reasons why deals get stuck in a pipeline, such as \u2013\u00a0No proper nurturing\u00a0Lack of attentionNot a streamlined qualification process\u00a0Lack of follow-up\u00a0Delay in approaching the prospects\u00a0Enough trust and rapport hasn\u2019t been built with the prospect\u00a0Opportunities don\u2019t stay for long. When you get an opportunity,\u00a0you\u00a0should\u00a0grab it\u00a0at once. A\u00a0slight\u00a0delay and you might miss out on a lucrative opportunity.\u00a0The deals should be approached in real-time. Prospects should see the value of the product during the early stages of the sales process. It is essential to build a good rapport and earn trust during the initial few conversations with the prospects.The most important thing is that the deals should be qualified and tagged as hot deals at the right time. The prospects who don\u2019t need the product will obviously get stuck in the process. So it is pivotal to qualify the deal and abandon the bad ones to maintain a healthy pipeline.\u00a0\u00a0The more time a deal stays in the pipeline, the less likely it is to convert. So,\u00a0manage your sales pipeline\u00a0effectively. Make sure you take quick action to move the deals from one stage to another.\u00a0\u00a0Tips to move deals from\u00a0one\u00a0stage to otherFrequently moving deals are a sign of a healthy sales pipeline. However, they aren\u2019t going to move on their own. You need to give them real-time attention and put in efforts to ensure your deals in motion. Each stage in the sales pipeline is essential.\u00a0So every stage needs to be given equal attention.\u00a0Here is what you need to do to move the deals from one stage to other.\u00a0\u00a01. Look at the stages and analyze the deals\u00a0\u00a0It is time to take a closure look at your sales pipeline. Analyze your sales pipeline and get everything organized. Prioritize your deals as per their value. Take a look at each stage of the sales pipeline individually. See which deals are stuck for a long period of time.\u00a0\u00a0Create different segments to gain more clarity.\u00a0The first segment can have all deals whose value is very high (the big accounts).\u00a0\u00a0The second segment can have deals that have chances of converting into sales.\u00a0The third segment can have deals stuck in the pipeline for a long time.\u00a0\u00a0The fourth segment can have deals that are in the early stage of the sales process.\u00a0\u00a0Mention the stages in which the deals are to understand which stage needs more attention.\u00a0Once the deals are streamlined, it will become easier to plan ahead for moving the stuck deals.\u00a02. Identify the problems that are occurring\u00a0\u00a0Now that you\u2019ve segmented the deals,\u00a0find out the reason why the deals were stuck.\u00a0For instance, some of the high-value deals had price issues.\u00a0\u00a0Or\u00a0\u00a0The deals that have high chances of closing weren\u2019t followed-up.\u00a0Or\u00a0\u00a0The deals that have been stuck for a long time weren\u2019t given attention at the right time.\u00a0\u00a0Or\u00a0\u00a0Most of the new deals weren\u2019t approached.\u00a0\u00a0Besides these, there can be many other reasons why the deals are getting stuck in the pipeline. So take a look at individual deals and find out the reasons.\u00a0\u00a03. Conduct a deal strategy session\u00a0\u00a0Now that you know the problem,\u00a0create a plan to resolve and move the deal ahead. A strong strategy is needed to move the deal ahead. Pay attention to each stage and plan systematically.\u00a0\u00a0Each stage is different, so you need to approach it differently.\u00a0\u00a0For instance, if the deal is stuck at the appointment setting stage, then there is a long way to go. Besides, if it is stuck in the negotiation stage, then you need to coordinate and address the prospects\u2019 concerns for closing the deal.\u00a0\u00a0Make sure you have a plan for each segment that you\u2019ve created. State clearly\u00a0what actions need to be taken to move deals in each segment. The\u00a0goal\u00a0should be properly defined and executed to bring the deals in motion.\u00a0\u00a04. Give deals a gentle nudge to move ahead\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Follow-up is an essential\u00a0part of sales. Lack of follow-up is one of the major reasons why the deals get stuck in the pipeline. No matter which stage the prospect is in, it is necessary to follow up.\u00a0\u00a0Most sales professionals give up after one follow-up and focus on other deals. Those deals get stuck in the pipeline and ultimately slip through the crack. So a little nudging is necessary.\u00a0\u00a0Yes, with a long to-do list and many deals to approach, follow-up might seem like a tedious task. However, there is always a smart way "

Yes, gone are the days where customers would wait for hours to get a revert.\u00a0Study shows that 42% of customers on social media\u00a0expect a response within 60 minutes.\u00a0From the stats, it\u2019s fair to say that if\u00a0you snooze, you lose.\u00a0Your customer support team needs to be on their toes, attending to visitors without any kind of delay. To avoid any mismanagement and streamlined communication, many companies are now adopting live chat tool into their CRM.\u00a0To enhance your customer support team\u2019s performance, you need a live chat tool that connects them with your visitors in real-time. Also, live chat lets you engage in a personalized way to deliver better services. So, let\u2019s find out how a customer support team can benefit from live chat software.\u00a01. Offer real-time help to customers\u00a0\u00a0When it comes to customer support, IVR is a commonly used method of communication between a company and its users. However, do you think that you can achieve higher customer satisfaction with customer call support where they have to stay on hold for hours just to get to the right representative?\u00a0I assume the answer to that would be no; it\u2019s not feasible to expect high customer retention with a fragmented support portal.\u00a0Using\u00a0live chat, your\u00a0visitor or customer can reach the right person with just a single click. It eliminates the lengthy process of IVR and provides customized solutions in no time. Therefore, an online chat tool is an ideal tool for every company that wants to keep its customer delighted and capture more leads.\u00a02. Higher response rateThe best feature of live chat is that it helps you provide immediate assistance to your visitors. In fact,\u00a079% of customers\u00a0share that they prefer to communicate via live chat because of the immediacy it offers. And that\u2019s something that you certainly shouldn\u2019t neglect. Live chat is currently the most preferred mode of communication among consumers.\u00a0When you\u2019re working with a customer support team, you have sufficient resources to communicate with multiple visitors at a time. You can assign chats to other available support agent so no visitor needs to wait to initiate conversation.\u00a0\u00a0Failing to provide an instant response may certainly lead to losing business. According to\u00a0Forrester\u2019s Raising the Bar\u00a0report,\u00a01 in 5 customers\u00a0is willing to stop using a product or service due to delayed response during a live chat. With a substantial number of customers relying on instant\u00a0replies\u00a0via live chat, it\u2019s crucial to have transparency. Live chat lets your customers know the availability time so they know whether they\u2019d receive a response on weekends or during business hours.\u00a03. Saves a lot of timeA higher response\u00a0rate of the live chat tool helps save a lot of time for both parties. According to\u00a0Zopim\u2019s\u00a0analysis of over 85k chats, it was revealed that on average, an agent replies to a customer query within 23 seconds, while the average resolution time is less than 42%. Now, that\u2019s a\u00a0surprising statistic\u00a0when we\u2019re talking about saving time by using live chat as a conversational tool.\u00a0When the users start receiving such swift replies to their queries, it\u2019ll raise the bar and provide you a competitive edge among others, leading to higher customer satisfaction and increased ROI.\u00a04. Chat\u00a0transcripts\u00a0for better contextTo provide enhanced customer service, your customer support team needs to be well acquainted with the common queries and concerns of the customers. They can leverage the existing chat transcript and refer to it for further assistance to their customers.\u00a0Chat transcripts mainly help in providing better context and understanding the needs of your users. The customer support team can utilize the existing chat transcripts and gain knowledge on the commonly asked queries so they can train other support team agents as well and improve their productivity.\u00a0For example, if your company frequently receives questions on the features and their use cases, you can use the chat transcripts to provide immediate responses and solve customer queries within minutes.\u00a05. Refer to previous conversations and avoid repetitionNo customer likes to repeat the same information to another customer support agent. Since your customers are already running out of time, you don\u2019t want to make them go away by asking repetitive questions now and again.\u00a0Live chat consists of robust features, and conversation history is one of the essential features. The live chat tool automatically saves contact history, so the next agent can start off right from where the previous one left the conversation.\u00a0For your ease of use, the entire chat history is saved in live chat, so when you\u2019re moving the deal through the pipeline, and your sales rep wants to get a better understanding of the customer\u2019s requirement, they can also access the conversation history and offer a better value proposition.\u00a06.

Marketing, Sales, Customer Service, Recruiting and Public Relations, all of these departments that depend on building and nurturing relationships need a tool like CRM.\u00a0\u00a0CRM lets start-ups like yours stay organized and get more customers in order to grow your business with time.\u00a0Seeing it as an expense is quite obvious for you, since you are just starting out, however, there are many\u00a0reasons\u00a0why you should understand why a CRM is an investment rather than being an expense.\u00a0Here\u2019s how a CRM helps you grow your start-up-\u00a01. Helps you collect leads coming from different sources\u00a0Start-ups collect leads from many sources like websites, tradeshows, social media, email campaigns, cold calls, references for their revenue cycle.\u00a0CRM helps them fetch these leads from different sources and store them in a centralized platform, so that your sales team can take the next step by identifying\u00a0the potential leads and assigning them to the right sales rep.\u00a0By knowing which\u00a0stage\u00a0a particular lead is on, sales reps can then move those leads up the sales funnel and close more deals without much\u00a0hassle.\u00a0Similarly, sales reps can monitor lead details, queries, and every communication held with them.\u00a0With the help of a CRM, start-ups cannot only\u00a0fetch data but also identify the most promising\u00a0lead\u00a0generation source.\u00a02.

            "content": "Every interaction with a customer or prospect contributes towards establishing your brand.\u00a0Majority of companies run email campaigns, and to analyze its performance, they opt for tracking of email clicks and opens.\u00a0So, you get a clear picture of how your emails are being\u00a0delivered and performing.\u00a0Now, with\u00a0Salesmate\u2019s\u00a0exclusive update, you get to create a custom domain tracking URL for tracking your outgoing emails. So, how does the custom tracking domain help your company? Generally,\u00a0Salesmate\u00a0uses a default domain for tracking email clicks and opens, and although it fetches the same results, there are certain additional benefits of using a custom domain.By using a custom domain, the servers recognize your company domain, and the email stands out among others. You can easily set up your custom domain and use email tracking features such as \u201cemail opens,\u201d and \u201cemail clicks\u201d to build credibility or plan your follow-ups among your prospects.\u00a0\u00a0First, let\u2019s get insight into how email tracking for opens and clicks work.\u00a0Open tracking\u00a0Open tracking comes into play when the prospect clicks on any email they receive. While running campaigns, you need to know how many emails were opened by the users, and this functionality enables you to get information for the same.\u00a0Right when the user clicks on an email, an almost invisible, 1-pixel image linked to the Html version gets downloaded, and that\u2019s how you gain insight into every email opened.\u00a0\u00a0With open tracking feature, you can analyze how your emails are doing and map out your strategy based on that. Moreover, when you use a custom domain for email tracking, the image that gets downloaded will reflect your name, which boosts credibility.\u00a0Click tracking\u00a0Click tracking follows a similar structure; it collects information on how many users clicked on the link in the email.\u00a0Tracking email clicks is highly beneficial as it helps you track every time a prospect clicks on the link in the email.\u00a0 So, let\u2019s find out how the click tracking functionality works.\u00a0When a prospect clicks on the tracked link in your email, it redirects them to the\u00a0destination\u00a0domain, and\u00a0during that process, the click is counted to derive insights on your email campaign.\u00a0The entire process is executed within seconds, therefore it\u2019s practically unnoticeable by anyone. So, when you track the clicks with your customized domain, your\u00a0domain name will reflect in the link.\u00a0Your users can easily see the tracking domain by hovering over the link, and\u00a0the name of your website on the\u00a0URL\u00a0certainly adds a personalized touch.\u00a0What are the benefits of getting custom domain for email tracking?\u00a0While everyone is using the default domain for tracking emails, having your own customized\u00a0URL\u00a0adds value to the services you provide. Here\u2019s why custom domains for tracking are advantageous for every company \u2013\u00a0\u00a0Use custom domain to combat spams\u00a0When running email campaigns and tracking emails, white labeling has become a\u00a0necessity. You don\u2019t want your emails to land into customers\u2019 spam folders. Therefore, when the tracking\u00a0URL\u00a0is of the same name as your company, the servers recognize it as reliable and helps you reach directly to your\u00a0prospect\u2019s\u00a0inbox.\u00a0Developing trustworthiness among prospects\u00a0Prospects\u00a0believe\u00a0in a thorough knowledge of the company they plan to associate with. Therefore, they might even take a glance at the tracking\u00a0URL\u00a0that\u2019s at the bottom of the window. So, when your own\u00a0URL\u00a0is used in the link, your prospect will know that they can\u00a0trust you for all the links sent through your domain.\u00a0Add value to your brandBy using your own\u00a0URL, you\u00a0create a\u00a0brand image that leaves a lasting impression on your prospects.

The rise in social media usage has shrunk the distance between a consumer and a company. Now, they\u2019re not just making a purchase; customers are interacting with sales executives and following their updates on various social media platforms.Customers are now more aware of their needs, and they\u2019ll convey it clearly too! With so many competitors in the market, customers have got a lot of options. So, how can you retain the customers?Now, this is where lead nurturing comes into the picture.To create an engaging and beneficial space for your customers, it\u2019s imperative to have an intuitive lead nurturing program. Before we step into the lead nurturing topic, let\u2019s first understand what exactly lead nurturing is.What is lead nurturing and why is it important?If your aim is to convert more prospects into customers, you need to implement a lead nurturing strategy. Now, your work isn\u2019t done after the deal is closed; you need to nurture the relationship to have a long-lasting relationship.By providing helpful information, understanding your subscribers\u2019 needs, and putting consistent efforts into engaging will certainly result in long-lasting relationships.The customer\u2019s perception is your reality. ~ Kate ZabriskieWhen you think the way your customer does, you\u2019re already halfway through your process of closing the deal. Put your customer in the spotlight; each one of them and nurture them to gain their loyalty.\u00a0With an intuitive lead nurturing campaign, you can understand buyers\u2019 interest when you engage with them and guide them through the sales funnel to turn them into loyal customers.You\u2019ll be surprised to know that 80% of new leads don\u2019t convert into sales. On the other hand, companies with an effective lead nurturing strategy generate 50% more sales at 33% lower cost! Moreover, nurtured leads experience a 23% shorter sales cycle (source \u2013 Market2Lead )\u00a0Therefore, if you want to stay on top of your game and build a loyal customer base, it\u2019s crucial to nurture them the right way. So, let\u2019s get an insight into lead nurturing to find out how it can help you build a strong customer relationship.Lead nurturing through various stagesThough the main focus of lead nurturing is to engage with customers, the endgame is to close every lead that comes your way.Not all inbound leads will be ready to make a purchase; you need to add lead nurturing to have a double impact on the existing leads. So, when you\u2019re planning a lead nurturing campaign, pay heed to the below stages to have a streamlined process of closing leads.1. AwarenessThis step is of utmost importance as this is where your prospect will become aware of your brand. A customer can come across your company website or page through any medium; a blog, advertisement, referral, or a marketing email. Therefore, it\u2019s vital to develop content that reflects your true values.\u00a0Customers will only be interested when they find something that could prove beneficial to them. Therefore, build a powerful brand image, know your strength, and use it effectively to attract potential buyers.\u00a0Awareness of the brand starts with developing effective content among various platforms. So, here\u2019s your chance to provide meaningful information to your prospects.Social media takes you one step closer to your prospects. The information and posts you share on various platforms create a higher impact on the viewers. When a prospect is interested in your content, they\u2019re more likely to click on that link and head over to your website or blog. Therefore, it\u2019s vital to create value-driven content.\u00a02. InterestNow that you\u2019ve made the customer aware of your brand, it\u2019s time to pique their interest. Understand your demographic and provide relevant content that they find useful. When you know what interests your customer, creating content according to that is a piece of cake!\u00a0When your viewers and potential customers are relying on you for valuable information, they\u2019ll easily provide their contact information. You can offer free webinars, eBooks, whitepapers, and various other useful content. Thereafter, you can add in your CTAs to quickly convert them into leads.\u00a03. EvaluationYour prospect is interested in your content, so what next? Well, this is where the main work comes into play. When your prospect viewed a file or downloaded an eBook, they must\u2019ve shared their information. Now, utilize the information of all your prospects and evaluate which leads you need to prioritize.To get straight to high-priority leads, you need to implement a lead score. The basic way to implement this is by qualifying leads in terms of Budget, Authority, Needs, Timeline. This is a crucial process as it will help you determine which lead is ready to go so you can directly assign it to your sales team.4. ConversionYour team collabora"

In inside sales, technology and the medium of connection play an important role.Inside sales teams are the first members who connect with prospects, understand their needs, answer their questions, and qualify them as a lead.Inside sales team takes the leads forward from the marketing team and makes sure the prospects fit with their product.Inside sales vs outside salesThe difference between inside and outside sales is pretty much evident.In outside sales, you have to travel places to meet prospects/customers.

According to Harvard Business Review, inside sales reduce the cost-of-sales by 40-90% compared to outside sales.What are the challenges faced by Inside Sales Reps?Inside sales, undoubtedly, is challenging.\u00a0However, once you get a hang of it, you understand that almost every sales rep faces the\u00a0same challenges\u00a0and ultimately overcome them.\u00a0In day-to-day sales, there are several forces that act as obstacles for the inside sales reps that make it difficult for them to meet their quotas.\u00a0\u00a0But,\u00a0where\u00a0there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s a way! There\u2019s absolutely no challenge that you, an inside sales representative cannot\u00a0get ahead of.\u00a0We have listed some of these challenges that you may face in your inside sales career and how you can overcome\u00a0them with just a little perseverance.\u00a01. Overcoming an increasing number of\u00a0competitions\u00a0These days, it\u2019s really easy to start a business. And with an increasing number of businesses coming up, there\u2019s also an increase in the competition.\u00a0\u00a0With this shift in the working environment, inside sales reps find it difficult to find new clients and retain them, especially when everyone out in the market has something better to offer.\u00a0How to overcome this challenge:\u00a0Study your competitors and understand what are they using\u00a0as their competitive advantage. Then assess your own USPs and present them the best way in front of your prospects to get their attention.\u00a0\u00a02. Not having enough time to get it all done\u00a0One thing that every sales rep is heard saying is that they don\u2019t have enough time.\u00a0While nurturing leads, taking follow-ups\u00a0with the prospects, making cold calls, scheduling meetings,\u00a0and entering data into the\u00a0system, inside sales reps lose a lot of their time throughout the day.\u00a0\u00a0How to overcome this challenge:\u00a0Businesses should invest in a CRM for their sales team so that their manual labor is reduced with the help of automation\u00a0and other essential productivity tools.\u00a0Also, sales reps should make sure they are not distracted\u00a0by the exterior factors like in-office noises and\u00a0social media notifications on their phones.\u00a03. Ensuring that they get high-quality leadsIt\u2019s no wonder that sales reps get across a number\u00a0of leads every day. However, not every\u00a0lead that the marketing team shares\u00a0is the right one. Prospecting\u00a0the right leads is one of the most tedious tasks for any sales reps,"

            "content": "Enterprise sales was a distant idea to me. And writing an article on it, almost an impossible task for an enterprise newbie like myself.And so I decided to consult my friend Jay, an enterprise sales expert.\u201cHow do you manage to excel at Enterprise Sales, Jay?\u201d I asked.And so he presented me with a detailed guide on how one can leverage Enterprise Sales to grow their business and scale it.\u201cIt\u2019s quite a simple idea, Parijat, if you think about it. It\u2019s just a matter of practice and skills that you can develop in no time. This is how I make the best out of Enterprise sales\u2013\u201dFor me, sales is all about building relationships, as it should be for every sales rep out there. After all, how do you think you can sell your services to a stranger who can\u2019t even trust you?When it comes to Enterprise Sales, nurturing relationships is everything. And nurturing one\u2019s relations starts with building a rapport with your clients first.Do you know what I say when I go to a prospect for the first time?\u201cHelp me help you,\u201d just like Jerry Maguire.I have met many salespeople who wish to excel at Enterprise sales but aren\u2019t able to. The reason for their failure? They don\u2019t ask enough questions. Especially the right questions.So let\u2019s start with the basic ones.What is enterprise sales?\u201cYou can\u2019t run a business without taking risks.\u201d- Millard DrexlerEnterprise Sales or complex sales are the ones that involve long sales cycles, multiple decision-makers, and higher levels of risks than traditional sales.To put it simply, Enterprise Sales involves large-scale corporate solutions, and since it takes a long time to close every deal, it comes with its own set of risks.A typical enterprise sales model is marked by the following:High risksMany stakeholdersLong sales cycle (6+ months)High investmentComplexityNow that you know the definition, your question here should be, \u201cIs Enterprise sales right for my business?\u201dAs a sales rep specializing in Enterprises, I would like to tell you that this segment of sales is not fit for just every business. But there are ways in which you can know if you need it for yours, and if the answer is yes, then how can you scale it.With the high risks that it puts up, enterprise sales aren\u2019t generally preferable for startups, and are more common in mature businesses that are already generating good revenue, and have the potential to take risks.However, in certain situations, enterprise sales can be just what your business needs!I, for instance, sell a CRM for all sorts of businesses. Since I work for a SaaS company, my service becomes essential for large corporations, where my solutions directly impact their business operations and strategies.Let\u2019s go through my sales routine in order to understand how Enterprise sales helped my company scale its growth while providing value to our customers.How I sell services to enterprisesBefore I reach a prospect, I tend to study about them and their business, and above all, I try to figure out if they would need my services, and if yes, then how will I be able to help them.Yes, your duty as a sales representative is to help your clients. You either make them realize there\u2019s an issue they need to resolve, or you provide a solution to a problem they already know about.Here\u2019s the set of questions I ask myself before setting up a meeting with the prospect:1. OnboardingWhat\u2019s to think about onboarding, you\u2019d ask. However, this step is indeed the toughest of all. All your sales processes end at this stage, but this is where your service starts to take shape.Will the onboarding process be smooth, without causing any trouble to the client?I always ask this question, because, for any sales rep, the client comes first.2. SecurityWhat if my service causes any security issues to my clients? Is it going to be safe for them to use my services?The SaaS product that I sell, as mentioned above, provides top-class security to my clients. Hence, I am covered on that part. Are you? Think.3. Post-sales supportYour role does not end when a sale is made. In fact, providing proper post-sales support to your clients is an important part of maintaining good relationships with them.Prepare yourself for any objections and queries so that it doesn\u2019t come as a surprise later.4. Proof of return on investmentWhen a company invests in a service or product, it expects good returns on it too.For example, if my clients bought our CRM solution for their startup, they would want better results from it, like data management and automation. Ask yourself if this investment would be worth it for your client.5. AutomationImagine how your client would react if your service adds to his workload instead of lessening it? Not a good scenario to imagine eh?I am always certain that my clients will always get the best automation solution if they buy my CRM, hence, I rest assured, and so are my clients.6. Social proofTo date, I have sold my solution to a number of companies, and so when I am about to approach another one, I can"

Write a subject line that your prospect can\u2019t ignoreBefore making a deal, they can\u2019t refuse, create a subject line that they definitely can\u2019t ignore. Sales reps often give the least importance to subject lines, which is concerning as it can either make or break a proposal.When writing a subject line, focus on the keywords. Grab prospects\u2019 attention with words and phrases they want to read. If they\u2019re looking for some new project, mention it; if you think the prospect may be interested in the offers you\u2019ve got, proceed with that.

            "content": "Selling is an art.It takes both talent and skills, and a lot of practice to make a genius salesperson out of a regular one.Just like any other occupation, sales require patience and a good understanding of the human psyche. As they say, a good salesperson is the one who understands his customers\u2019 needs.\u201cDon\u2019t find customers for your products. Find products for your customers\u201d- Seth GodinIt\u2019s no rocket science that every sales rep should have a good command over his communication skills and how he presents his product- not to sell but to provide a solution. After all, everyone is looking for an answer, so it\u2019s essential to show them value, not just price.In today\u2019s digital world, there are several solutions available. However, getting the right one is a whole different story. Hence, it becomes a salesperson\u2019s duty to rescue his customers from the dilemma of choosing.When it comes to virtual selling, many sales reps find it challenging to build a rapport with their potential customers. This makes them lose deals and hinder their revenue growth.Digital selling is the new normalYes, that\u2019s the bitter truth. With a changing world, the norms of the corporate world are changing too.\u00a0Due to the pandemic, 163% more sellers were found shifting to virtual selling. And according to firms like Brian and McKinsey, virtual selling will continue to take over face-to-face selling even after the pandemic is over!From saving your travel time to providing momentum to your customers\u2019 decision making, virtual selling has its pros and cons.Many sellers noted that virtual selling did not let them build a lasting relationship with their customers, which affected their long-term sales goals. Also, they said that keeping their customers interested was a laborious process.\u201cSales is not about selling anymore, it\u2019s about building trust and educating.\u201d- Siva DevakiBeing in front of the camera and trying to win over people isn\u2019t everyone\u2019s cup of tea. It comes with a lot of challenges, and salespeople make mistakes during the process.Leveraging virtual sales can be a big step for many salespeople, and for that, you need to stop making these common mistakes.These mistakes in selling virtually can cost you more than you thinkMistakes are the first step towards learning. However, making too many of them can turn out to be fatal for your growth. We have listed eight common mistakes that almost every sales rep makes during a virtual selling session that, if avoided, can yield some amazing results for you!1. Keeping the conversation one-wayDo you feel an urge to fill the vacuum in between words while on a call to avoid awkwardness?Our advice? Don\u2019t do it!A sales pitch should never be a monologue but a conversation. Ask your customers what they are looking for, and then give them a solution that fits them best.Solution: Let others talk too, be a good listener.2. Not putting in enough efforts to build relationships\u2018Relationship\u2019 is the buzzword in your profession. Never forget that.Most people who are new to the virtual world try to keep their sessions shorter than in-person meetings. Result? Less time for rapport-building.More than 50% of buyers, according to RAIN group\u2019s Virtual Selling Skills and Challenges Study, say their decision of buying depends on their relationship with the seller. However, according to the buyers, only 25% of sellers are effective at building lasting relationships.Solution: Work on relationship management even if you are meeting your clients online.3. Not doing enough researchA meeting without an agenda is just a waste of time. And no one likes their time to be wasted.Salespeople often forget to plan their online meeting, due to which the meeting remains directionless, and your potential customer loses his interest in your pitch.Do your research beforehand, and share a proper agenda with your clients before the meeting begins. You can also ask them to make any necessary changes accordingly so that both sides are on the same page (or screen)!Solution: Structure your meeting, and include your clients into the plan.4. Allowing technical issues ruin the momentDo you like talking to a frozen screen?Of course not. Nor do your clients.Technical glitches can be a huge turn off for your clients and lead to a loss of a deal, even if it\u2019s properly structured.What good is your pitch if you can\u2019t deliver it smoothly?Work on these issues beforehand, ensure you have a stable internet connection, and all your videos are running properly.Solution: Take a dry run before you start the meeting.5. Staring at yourselfEveryone gets a bit self-conscious sitting in front of the camera, especially when you are selling.But what happens when you keep staring at yourself during the meeting?Well, your clients might not catch you red-handed, but you will surely miss their reactions. When you don\u2019t pay attention to what they feel, you don\u2019t understand why and how the meeting didn\u2019t go in your favor.Solution: Look for minute reactions from your client"

            "content": "Managing your sales pipeline plays a vital role in the growth of your business. \u201cGetting prospects into the pipeline\u201d is a widespread phrase you\u2019d hear when you move through any sales circle. But what does it mean to \u2018get\u2019 prospects into a pipeline?\u201cSetting goals is the first step in turning the invisible into the visible.\u201d -Tony Robbins.Yes, you got it right!Setting goals is what a sales pipeline helps you with. In today\u2019s digitally-connected world, every industry is turning more data-driven and requires facts and figures right at their fingertips.Sales pipeline management is the one step you take to get closer to your sales quotas and achieve your revenue goals.Like said before, a sales pipeline gets your goals into a perspective so that you can focus only on the important and leave the rest for later.What is a sales pipeline?A sales pipeline is a visual representation of where a particular lead stands in the sales process. It shows how many deals a salesperson has closed or is about to close in a week, month, or over a quarter, to achieve sales quotas.Maintaining a healthy pipeline allows you to build your approach towards your targets, and bring in as much business as expected of you.Say, for example, your pipeline is worth $100,000, and your conversion rate from lead to sale is 10%, then you can expect to close $10,000 worth of business. However, if your target is $20,000, you\u2019ll either have to line up more prospects or convert twice as many leads to achieve your sales quotas.This is where sales pipeline analysis comes in handy. When you have a clear view of your prospects and conversion rates, you can plan your sales strategies accordingly and get better results sooner.A sales pipeline is an essential sales management tool that helps you increase your sales team\u2019s productivity. It also gives you a precise forecast of where your business is heading towards.Benefits of a sales pipelineAccording to a Harvard Business Review survey, there was an 18% difference in revenue growth between the companies that had a formal sales process than those that didn\u2019t. Thus, having a sales pipeline in your arsenal can come with many benefits that can help you boost your business growth. Let\u2019s have a look into why and how managing a sales pipeline can help you grow more revenue:1. You can monitor your sales team\u2019s performanceEach stage requires a list of actions to be completed to move a lead forward. Sales pipeline helps managers to monitor their teams\u2019 performance at each sales stage and take necessary measures towards their better performance.2. You can make better forecastsWith details of the leads placed in the pipeline, it becomes easy to forecast whether it\u2019ll get closed or not, and if it does, then how much revenue would it generate. You get to know how close your sales team is to reaching their targets, making it easy to reach your revenue goals in a given time frame.3. You get to increase total sales volume and revenue for your businessThe ultimate goal of any business is to grow its revenue and increase in size. Thus, anything that helps in doing so is advisable. Sales pipeline makes it easy for you and your team to understand which sales stage produces better results quickly and which steps can be ignored.4. You can nurture leads betterSince you get all the information on each lead in a single place, it becomes easier to provide them with more personalized services and nurture them better at each sales stage.\u00a0Sales pipelines help sales reps to naturally maintain the relationships by giving an insight into the needs and wants of their customers.5. You can track deals and their progressIt gets tough for you and your team when you cannot note where a specific deal is heading. Maintaining a sales pipeline helps you track all the deals at hand while providing room to nurture and close them in minimum time.Stages of a sales pipelineEvery process has several stages that one needs to go through to complete it. Sales pipeline has a similar structure that allows you to segregate leads according to their stage where they stand:1. ProspectingEvery pipeline starts with the same step- finding new prospects who are searching for what you are selling. However, the prospecting process might differ from company to company.\u00a0Some organizations have a different lead generation team. Sometimes, leads are generated through downloadable content, social media, or website, or when a potential client expresses his interest in your services. You can also go through cold leads that might look like potential buyers.Once the prospecting is done, you move your leads to a second stage- Qualifying leads.2. QualifyingThe second step in your pipeline can sometimes be called the most important one. You don\u2019t want your representatives to waste their time on inappropriate leads or those not interested.This is the research part, where you contact the lead and find out more about their work and whether they would be interested in your services.

            "content": "Enterprise sales is undoubtedly a hard nut to crack. But if done right, it can augment your business revenue.\u00a0Besides, there are even possibilities of repeat business and high-quality referrals that can acquaint you with lucrative opportunities.\u00a0Moreover, working with well-known clients can also bring credibility that can lead to better things.Businesses can easily trust you when they see the testimonial from renowned enterprises.\u00a0Yes, you\u2019ll find many hurdles on the path while selling to enterprises, but a firm determination and constant hard work can lead you to success.\u00a0\u201cSuccess is the sum of small efforts repeated day in and day out. \u2013 Robert Coller\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0A different and long pathway while selling to enterprises\u00a0Selling to a large enterprise is a different game. It is essential to know the rule of the game to win it. One must expect a long journey while selling to a large enterprise.Persistence and calmness are two essential traits needed during enterprise sales, as there are chances that the deal might fall apart at any stage of the sales prospect. There can be many reasons for the loss of sales, like the person you are coordinating with might leave the company, sudden changes in the economy, change in priorities, etc.\u00a0However, you shouldn\u2019t be demotivated, or else it might affect the next deal as well. You need to be very confident while communicating with big clients. If they smell nervousness or risk, they might lose interest.\u00a0\u201cSuccess is the sum of small efforts repeated day in and day out. \u2013 Robert Coller\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Checklist for selling to large enterprises\u00a0The world of large enterprises is different. Before approaching them, it is essential to be sure that you have a solution that can benefit them.\u00a0\u00a0Here is the checklist for selling to large enterprises.Be patient and move slowly\u00a0Closing enterprise sales requires a lot of time and effort. It won\u2019t happen in one or two calls. So you need to pursue it with unwavering determination. Large contracts consume more time as the prospect usually don\u2019t have enough time.They might not receive your call or respond to your emails, but that doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t interested in the solution. Only through constant follow-up, such big deals can be pushed ahead in the sales pipeline.\u00a0\u201c44% of sales reps give up after one follow-up.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Don\u2019t make this mistake of not following up with the prospect. Due to high pressure and several lucrative deals in the pipeline, there are chances you might forget to follow-up. However, there is a solution for this as well.\u00a0If you are using an advanced CRM, then well and good. If not, then opt for one of the modern CRM that allows you to automate your follow-up. For instance, Stalemate CRM enables you to create a sequence of emails to follow-up with your esteemed clients in real-time. By automating your follow-up, you can save a lot of time and prevent big deals from slipping through the crack.\u00a0Do your research\u00a0Impressing large enterprises is no easy task. Besides, it is challenging to connect with an influential person from the company. Once you manage to connect, you cannot let go of that opportunity. So make sure you research before dialing the prospect\u2019s number.\u00a0Study the prospect\u2019s company website thoroughly. Go through press and media release pages.Take the help of quora to understand what your prospect is hoping to learn. There are chances that the prospect might have posted a question regarding a challenge the company is facing. If you offer some tips during the call, the prospect will surely be impressed.\u201cWhen reps take the role of a curious student rather than an informed expert, buyers are much more inclined to engage. \u2013 Jeff HoffmanNowadays, reviews about enterprises in easily available on the internet. You can refer to those reviews to see what the customers feel about the enterprise and its product. This helps you in finding out the prospect\u2019s strengths and weaknesses.\u00a0Besides, even social media sites like LinkedIn and Twitter can help. If you find any mutual connection, you can connect with them to gather more information about the prospect.\u00a0Establish a relationshipA healthy relationship is the cornerstone of enterprise sales. So invest some time in establishing a healthy relationship with the prospect. Try to strike a meaningful conversation and build a good rapport.\u00a0Ask relevant questions to discover the business pain points of the prospect. Adapt the consultative selling approach and guide the prospect rather than selling them a product. Paint a positive picture by demonstrating interest in helping the prospect solve a specific business issue.\u00a0Share proven results\u00a0Enterprises want to see proof. Potential buyers from large enterprises don\u2019t want to know what all your product can do; they are interested in seeing how impactful the product has been in the past. They want to know the views of the customers who have already used the product. Has it helped them? If yes, then how? What difference did they experience after using y"

As a result, today\u2019s Finance CRM solution is not only a niche industry but a must-have set of tools that enable financial advisors and businesses to deliver personalized and streamlined financial planning services to their customers.\n\nRole of a CRM in your finance business\nCustomer Relationship Management tools are an essential investment you make toward the growth of your business. It is necessary to understand how a Finance CRM helps you to overcome any obstacles you face during the sales and lets you increase your revenue.\nFor sales reps\nA good CRM helps sales representatives get more productive and generate better sales results. A sales team becomes efficient when they are all on the same page, have all the data handy, and can easily communicate in and out of their team.\nFor sales managers\nManagers often face the problem of being unable to keep a tab on their sales team\u2019s activities.

As a result, they can manage things better without actively participating in sales processes.\nWhy do companies need a financial CRM?\nEvery financial company has a challenge to face, which is to meet customer expectations.

            "content": "Your sales success is dependent on your ability to handle and convert prospects into paying customers. Like all fingers of the hand aren\u2019t the same, even the sales world is filled with different types of prospects. So, the sales tactics that helped persuade one potential buyer might be ineffective while dealing with a different prospect.\u00a0A good understanding of different kinds of prospects can help in developing successful strategies.\u00a0It\u2019s not about having the right opportunities. It\u2019s about handling the opportunities right.\u00a0Types of prospects and how to sell to them\u00a0Prospects fall into different categories. Selling gets easier when you study the buying behavior pattern of each category.\u00a0Let\u2019s look at the various types of prospects:They know it all\u00a0These types of buyers think they don\u2019t have anything to learn from the sellers. They are well-informed about the market and have a good understanding of their problems as well as the solutions available in the market.Some prospects actually know a lot. However, you might even encounter prospects who feel they know it all but the reality would be something different. The prospect might not show a lot of interest in taking suggestions from you.\u00a0How to sell to these prospects\u00a0Be curious and find out how stubborn the prospect is and what information s/he has. Dig deeper and check how accurate their knowledge is.\u00a0Just sharing plain information won\u2019t work with these kinds of prospects. You need to play the game differently. Show them two different scenarios.\u00a0Their business with your solution\u00a0Their business without your solution\u00a0Help them visualize what benefits they will receive from using your solution. Even give them a glimpse into the consequences of not using the solution.Make multiple attempts with unwavering determination, but do know when to cut the ties. If the prospect is too rigid and isn\u2019t willing to listen to you, then just walk away. No matter how hard you try, you can\u2019t help a person who doesn\u2019t want the help. It is better to invest your time in some other deal instead.\u00a0The busy onesSome prospects genuinely don\u2019t have time. They are occupied with some or the other tasks which is why they do not get time to respond. Most of the sales reps misunderstand these prospects and stop reaching out to them which is why they lose many profitable opportunities.\u00a0How to sell to these prospects\u00a0Just because the prospects aren\u2019t responding doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t interested. These kinds of prospects need constant nudging. So to sell a product to these busy bees, you must follow-up constantly.\u00a0Sadly, 44% of sales reps give up 1 follow-up\u00a0Make sure you at least make three to four attempts to follow-up with a potential prospect. To simplify your work, you can embrace different types of sales automation. Thankfully most of the modern CRM software allows you to create a sequence of emails. So you can follow-up in real-time with the busy prospects.The confused ones\u00a0Some prospects are in need of the product, but they are confused with the many options available in the market. Every business wants to invest in a solution that gives them the best returns. This is why they ponder over a lot of things before settling for any solution. During this process, they often end up getting confused.\u00a0How to sell to these prospects\u00a0Confused prospects often have too many doubts and concerns hovering over their head. So, try to address these concerns and doubts. Earn their trust and confidence. Show them how your product is better than the other products available in the market.Take the help of the case studies of your successful clients to build credibility. Show how your happy customers chose you over the competitors and their benefits by using your product.\u00a0The unaware one\u00a0Some prospects have certain problems, but they are unaware of it. Or they try to ignore it. Prospects who aren\u2019t aware of a problem won\u2019t think about a solution; hence your product won\u2019t come into the picture.\u00a0Get closer to your customers. So close that you tell them what they need well before they realize it themselves \u2013 Steve JobsHow to sell to these prospects\u00a0To sell to these kinds of prospects, you need to make them realize that they have a problem; only then will they think about a solution(i.e., Your product). Asking relevant questions can help in drawing the prospect\u2019s attention to various problems that obstruct their path to growth.\u00a0Here are a few question examples for your reference:\u00a0Most of the companies in your industry have been affected by[ongoing crisis], are you too affected by it?\u00a0What are your business goals for the year?What\u2019s holding you back from achieving those business goals?Since when have you been facing this problem?How is this problem affecting your staff and customer?\u00a0The stallers\u00a0Some prospects use stalling tactics to delay the purchase. The more time the prospects take, the less likely are the chances of them converting into customers. They will try to ignore the conversation by saying, \u201cwe ne"

Constant failure leads to demotivation. They aren\u2019t able to think clearly due to low morale. Demotivated sales reps find even the simplest of tasks challenging.\u00a0Being the head of the team, you need to empower your sales team and boost their morale. Sales is like a puzzle; you need to help your team put the right pieces together for creating win-win situations.\u00a0A good objective of leadership is to help those who are doing poorly to do well and to help those who are doing well to do even better \u2013 Jim Rohn\u00a0How to motivate the sales team when sales is low?Falling into the pit of failure is the most horrible thing for sales reps. They feel stuck in one place and aren\u2019t able to do anything to get out. If you want to see good sales results, you\u2019ll have to put in efforts and pull out the team from the pit.\u00a0Here is how you can motivate the team when sales is low.Call in for a\u00a0 meeting and discuss the root cause\u00a0Why is your sales team performing poorly? Why aren\u2019t they able to persuade the prospects to purchase a product? What obstacles are they facing on the path to sales closure?\u00a0To find answers to these and many other questions convene your team fro a sales meeting.\u00a0Give everyone a few minutes to speak about the issues there are facing.Make a list of the key issues. Find out the reason for these issues.Example- Most of the sales reps aren\u2019t able to push the deals from the presentation stage to the next one. So, a lack of follow-up might be the reason.\u00a044% of sales reps give up after 1 follow-upSimilarly, look at other issues and try to find the solution. For instance, your sales team can automate the follow-up using the advanced tool and save a lot of time.\u00a0Even brainstorm new sales strategies with your team. Since old ones aren\u2019t effective, your team will have to change their approach.Blur the line between the sales manager and reporting employeeWhen there is a tone of authority, the sales reps cannot speak freely discuss their problem freely. So try to build a good rapport with each member of your team. Some introverts aren\u2019t comfortable sharing their problem in front of the whole team. They cannot articulate their thoughts clearly. This is why sometimes one-to-one meetings are required.\u00a0Earn the trust and make them comfortable to share the problems they are facing without hesitation.Only when you have a clear picture of their roadblock,  you\u2019ll be able to provide a solution and motivate them to work harder.\u00a0Train your sales team\u00a0Constant training is pivotal in sales. The competitors are doing all that it takes to attract your target audience. So when your team uses obsolete selling methods, they lose the prospects to the competitors.\u00a0Therefore provide regular training to your sales reps. Share new sales tactics to deal with challenging sales situations. Even encourage self-learning. Make sure your sales reps stay updated about the changing trends. Ask them to give suggestions for improving sales operations.\u00a0Create a culture of transparency and honesty\u00a0Some of the sales reps step on other\u2019s feet to achieve their quota. For instance, a sales rep is working on a deal that was about to close. Due to a medical emergency, he was on leave for a few weeks. In the meanwhile, his teammate called the prospect and tried to close a deal.\u00a0Such instances lead to negativity and demotivate the sales reps. Their sales performance is affected. So make sure you break the wall within the team and try to maintain transparency. The best way to do it is by implementing CRM software. Deals can easily be assigned and tracked. You can see who is working on which deals and what is the progress. This will decrease clashes and increase productivity.\u00a0Step in and support when required\u00a0Sometimes sales reps need a little guidance, help, and push to seal the deal. In a challenging scenario, you might have to step in and handle the situation. A small hint can help the sales reps solve the puzzle of sales.\u00a0You can listen to their recorded sales calls and see where are they going wrong.\u00a0 You can show them how a little tweak in their approach could change the result. Explain what more they can do to persuade a prospect to purchase a product.\u00a0Let people pick their own rewardSales rewards motivate sales reps to put in more effort. So make sure you have a reward system in place to drive performance. The best thing to do here is to allow the sales reps to choose their own rewards.\u00a0Sales reps will be motivated to work hard and achieve their sales goals to receive the rewards they wanted. Besides, when you acknowledge the hard work of the top performer and reward them even others get motivated to work harder.\u00a0Conclusion\u00a0Being a sales manager, you\u2019ve probably walked in the shoes of a sales rep. So, you are aware that selling is not an easy task. It is filled with challenges. Prospects don\u2019t easily purchase a product. Co"

Leads generated from a trusted source has high chances of converting into sales. Approach your networks who can acquaint you with a potential prospect who needs your product. Do not hesitate to ask referrals from friends, family, and satisfied customers.\u00a0You can also employ this sales approach to establish a new relationship with a potential buyer. Once you get the referral, use social media channels to connect with the potential prospect.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNetworking is simply the cultivating of mutually beneficial, give and take, win-win relationships. It works best, however, when emphasizing the \u201cgive\u201d part. \u2013 Bob Burg\u00a0The investigator sales approach\u00a0Investigate and inquire to learn about a business and its challenges. Businesses don\u2019t easily invest in a new solution. You need to convince them that your product is the best for their business. For that, a good understanding of their business pain points and goals is essential.\u00a0Besides, you need to determine whether your product can address the prospect\u2019s needs and provide value. So, for that, an in-depth research is needed.Try to garner as much information as you can. Be curious about the prospect\u2019s business needs. The more information you gather, the better you can help and close sales.\u00a0Curiosity is the endive of achievements \u2013 Ken RobinsonThe friend\u00a0 sales approach\u00a0This sales approach focuses on building a healthy relationship with the prospect. Earn the prospect\u2019s trust and confidence.\u00a0Only when a prospect is comfortable, they will speak about their business concerns. Have a warm and friendly approach. However, make sure you do not cross the line.\u00a0If people like you, they will buy from you.\u00a0Try to connect with the prospect at an emotional level. Be genuine; businesses understand when you are faking it.It is amazing what doors can open if you reach out to people with a smile, friendly attitude, and a desire to make a positive impact. \u2013 Richard BransonThe consultative selling sales approachThis sales approach emphasizes on, acting as a consultant to a potential prospect. This sales approach helps in understanding whats going on in the prospect\u2019s business to present the solution effectively.\u00a0Through relevant questions, you try to find out what problems is the potential prospect facing. Sometimes the prospects aren\u2019t fully aware of their problems. The questions help in bringing to light those problematic areas that are affecting the prospect\u2019s business.\u00a0Get close than ever to your customers. So close that you tell them what they need well before they realize themselves. \u2013 Steve Jobs\u00a0Have a meaningful conversation with your prospects. Listen to the prospect answers. Do not be in a hurry to ask the next question. Interruption can make a bad impression on the prospect. Active listening is important in consultative selling. Once you understand what they want, guide on what they should be doing to overcome the roadblock to success. Make them visualize how your product can be helpful here.\u00a0The solution selling sales approachThis is a simple sales approach where you discover the prospect\u2019s needs and recommend a solution to address those needs. Unlike the traditional sales approach, solution selling focuses on educating the prospect.\u00a0Here you give prospect tangible reasons for not only why their business should use your product but also how their business will benefit.

They explore various strategies and hacks to transform their game.\u00a0Like these players, even you\u2019ll have to play the game of sales differently by trying various hacks and strategies.\u201cSuccess is achieved and maintained by those who try and keep trying\u201d \u2013 W. Clement Stone\u00a0Read on, to find a few sales hacks that can help you in converting more deals into sales.Win more deals with these 7 sales hacks\u00a0Deals slipping from the sales pipeline isn\u2019t a pleasant sight. Here is how you can successfully close them.\u00a0Sales hack 1 \u2013 Hit the iron when it\u2019s hot- Reach out to the prospects at the right time\u00a0Hitting at the perfect timing is of paramount importance in sales. When disturbing a prospect with wrongly time communication, you decrease the chances of moving the deal ahead in the sales pipeline. So, be very careful while choosing a time for making a cold call or sending a follow-up email.\u00a0Analyze your sales report, research on the internet, and try to find the best time to reach out to a potential prospect.\u00a0According to the study conducted by Salesmate, 4:00 pm to 5:00 pm in the evening is the best time to make sales calls. The second best time to make sales calls is in the morning between 10:00 am to 11:00 am.\u00a0As per the data collected by Coschedule, 10 am is the best time to send a sales email.\u00a0Sales hack 2 \u2013 Step into your customer\u2019s shoe- Have a customer-centric approach\u00a0Businesses prefer to deal with companies that understand their pain points and challenges. So, have a customer-centric approach. Dig deeper into your potential buyer\u2019s problem and its root cause.\u00a0Find out from where they are facing a specific issue and how is it affecting their business.\u00a0Once you understand their problem, present your product as a solution. Show your prospect how your product can help them overcome a specific issue. Give real-life examples. Share case studies of customers who had a similar problem and try to earn the potential prospect\u2019s trust.Sales hack 3 \u2013 Set yourself up- Don\u2019t appear desperate for the dealProspect senses the desperation, and they play more tantrums to get the product at a price they desire. Yes, you have high pressure to meet the sales quotas, but you need to stay calm and take each step smartly. Do not emit a vibe of desperation.Instead, gain the upper hand by conveying the value of your product. Explain the consequences of not using your product. Make them realize that they need your product rather than making them feel that you are desperate for their paycheck.\u00a0Sales hack 4 \u2013 GIve another try \u2013 Make at least three to four attempts\u00a0Successful salespeople don\u2019t give up easily, which is why they successfully hit their sales targets. The sales reps who don\u2019t follow-up get stuck in the cycle of failure.\u00a0\u201c44% of salespeople give up after one follow-up call\u201dIf a prospect doesn\u2019t receive your call or respond to your email, do not jump to the conclusion that he/she isn\u2019t interested in your product.\u00a0Persistence is an essential trait in sales. Keep trying with unwavering determination; follow-up consistently.\u00a0There are chances that the prospect might be busy. So try to reach out to your prospect again on a different day. You can even use a modern sales tool that allows you to put your follow-up on auto-pilot. This will help you in saving time.\u00a0Sales hack 5 \u2013 Explore different channels \u2013 Try texts or LinkedIn to connect\u00a0Do not confine yourself to sales calls and emails, explore different communication channels to nurture your deals. You can connect with your prospects through text messages(SMS). People respond quickly to text messages.\u00a0\u201c90% of text messages are read within 3 minutes\u00a0So use text messages to follow-up and send reminders to your prospects. Besides text messages, you can leverage the power of LinkedIn to build and maintain a healthy relationship with your prospects. Follow your prospects on LinkedIn. Comment on their posts If you find something interesting, discuss it while conversing over the phone. Try to make them as comfortable as possible.\u00a0Sales hack 6 \u2013 Be prepared \u2013 list down objections and find ways to tackle it\u00a0In sales, you often face objections.

            "content": "Demos are by far the most effective method of showing off a product\u2019s capabilities. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic has made in-person product demo meetings more challenging.\u00a0However, video conferencing allows you to perform virtual product demos without ever leaving the comfort of your home office. With so many people working remotely for the foreseeable future, virtual product demos are becoming increasingly popular.\u00a0Read on to learn how to conduct the perfect virtual demo that shows off your product at its best and converts prospects into customers.\u00a0Know your prospectThe worst mistake you can make is failing to do your research. Customers are discerning, and they expect a personalized approach. The prospect you\u2019re going to meet has probably seen multiple product demos already, so you need to stand out if you want to close the sale. Therefore, you must learn all you can about the person and their business before your meeting.\u00a0At a minimum, you should know the names and job roles of everyone attending your demo. You can learn more about them by checking out their LinkedIn profiles ahead of time.\u00a0You can also send out a short pre-meeting questionnaire to learn more about your prospect, the issues they face, and the need they\u2019re hoping your product will address. The more information you gather, the more you\u2019ll be able to tailor the demo to them.\u00a0Pro tip: don\u2019t just rely on your memory. Make notes and bring them to the meeting.\u00a0Make it personal and relevant\u00a0This may seem counterintuitive, but your product should not be the center of the product demo. Your prospect must be the primary focus, and your demo must be relevant to them. Of course, you want to show off your product\u2019s features, but ensure you do so in a way that addresses the prospect\u2019s needs and concerns.\u00a0Clients are looking for a solution to their problem, so by identifying and addressing their pain points in your demo, you bring yourself closer to closing the sale.Here\u2019s an example of how the demo might go:\u00a0\nAn overview of the client\u2019s current processes and business goals.Pain points that cause the client to lose revenue.\u00a0An introduction to your solution.A demonstration of your solution and how it solves the problem the client identified.\u00a0The opportunity for questions and clarification. This step also gives you the opportunity to address sales objections.\u00a0To take the personalization to the next level, customize the demo version of the product, too. For instance, you could add their logo, color scheme, and relevant data.\u00a0There are interactive product demo tools built to speed up the personalization process. Walnut is arguably the market leader, but Walnut alternatives like Navattic & Reprise offer similar solutions.Example-\u00a0If you\u2019re demoing an ecommerce software, why not add a few items from their inventory to show off your product at work? This customization process adds a bit more work, but it also allows the prospect to envision your product as part of their business.\u00a0Whatever system you use, ensure that the client is front and center. Take them on a journey, telling a story where they are the main character, and your product plays a supporting role. A generic sales pitch won\u2019t cut it.\u00a0Pinpoint where the prospect is on the customer journeyCustomers do not make decisions on the fly. Before they make a large purchase, they do their research. Many will reach out to multiple vendors and may participate in several product demos before making a decision. The relationship you have with the prospect, from that first point of contact through to the sale and beyond, is called the customer journey.\u00a0A customer journey map marks the key points of interaction between your brand and a prospective customer. To map your customer journey, stop thinking about your product and start thinking about the customer experience.\u00a0A typical customer journey includes five main phases: searching for a solution, evaluating different solutions, experimentation, purchase, and retention.\u00a0This useful example from CXL can help you work out what those stages look like in the context of your business:\u00a0Source: CXLOnce you know where a prospect is in the customer journey, you can tailor your demo accordingly. A prospect in the awareness stage may have little knowledge of your product and how it can help them. But by the decision stage, they might be making a final decision between an expensive, cutting-edge solution and one with fewer features but a lower price point.\u00a0Adapting your product demo to the prospect\u2019s customer journey position allows you to give them a demo that will address their immediate needs and questions. If they\u2019re in an earlier stage of the journey, a great demo can move them down the sales pipeline to the next stage. If they\u2019re in the decision stage, the perfect demo can be just what is needed to close the deal and get their signature on the dotted line.\u00a0Know your products and services inside-outKnowing your product means more than just memorizing the technical"

You might have even had negative experiences where the meetings were uninteresting, long, and not at all motivating.Don\u2019t be like those managers who walk into the meeting room, provide a series of updates, speak about their expectations, and walk out after two hours.You would want to empower your team and lead them in the right direction so that they keep hitting their sales numbers. To achieve the sales team\u2019s goals, every sales rep in the team must achieve their individual sales quota. For that, proper guidance and feedback are required.\u00a0Running an effective sales meeting can help boost growth, improve efficiency, and increase the sales team\u2019s productivity.\u00a0\u201cLeaders become great not because of their power but because of their ability to empower others. \u2013 John MaxwellTips for running successful sales meetingsEvery year, businesses waste $37 billion on ineffective meeting\u00a0Companies rely on the sales team to bring in new customers and contribute to the business revenue. Every minute of a sales representative is precious. The one or two hours that they spend on the meeting could be used for prospecting or nurturing a deal. So, if the team is investing their time in a meeting, as the head of the team, you need to make sure it doesn\u2019t go in vain. The sales meeting should help them improve their performance and sales results.\u00a0Here are the things you need to do before and during a sales meeting.\u00a0Things to do before the sales meeting\u00a0Make sure you plan and prepare for your sales team meeting to ensure you don\u2019t end up wasting your sales reps\u2019 time. Here are two things you must consider doing before a sales team meeting.\u00a0Sales meeting tip 1 \u2013 Analyze sales reports and track progress\u00a0Are your sales reps hitting their targets?What issues is your team facing while closing a deal?Where are your sales reps spending their time?You need to find out answers to these and many more questions before convening your team for the next sales meeting.\u00a0Create sales reports to analyze the performance of each member of your team.\u00a0A sales CRM software can be a great tool to track your team\u2019s performance and see the status of the deals. Using such a smart sales tool, you can spot the performance gap and problem area that needs immediate attention.\u00a0Sales meeting tip 2 \u2013 Set agenda and time limit\u00a0 for the meeting\u00a0Based on the analysis, create an agenda for the meeting. The agenda should be clearly defined to ensure all the necessary points are covered. Set a time limit for your meeting. Keep it to an hour max. If you can cover every point in 30 minutes, then it is advisable.\u00a0Attention begins to drop off rapidly after thirty minutes, with an average of 84% of attendees paying attention at the thirty-minute mark, falling to 64% at the forty-five-minute mark.To avoid wasting time, break that 30 to 40 minutes meeting into various parts.\u00a0For instance, in the first five minutes, you can appreciate the efforts of the sales rep who has performed exceptionally well in the previous month.\u00a0In the next ten minutes, everybody can share their achievements for the month.The next ten minutes can be dedicated to discussing the key issue.\u00a0The last ten minutes can be spent on discussing the solution and the next step.\u00a0Things to do during the meeting\u00a0Effective meetings can change the sales game and make your sales team more efficient. Here are things you must consider to move your sales meetings to the next level.\u00a0Sales meeting tip 3- Acknowledge performance\u00a0Salespeople love recognition. It motivates them to work harder. Even if you\u2019ve sent an appreciation email to the top sales performer, you must speak about their achievements during the sales meeting.\u00a0Give them the praises they deserve in public. Such recognition even encourages other members of the team to walk that extra mile.\u00a0Appreciation can make a day, even change a life. Your willingness to put into words is all that is necessary.\u201d \u2013 Margaret CousinsSales meeting tip 4 \u2013\u00a0 Focus on one key issueDo not try to discuss a lot of issues in one meeting.It is better to speak about one issue in detail than discuss a lot of things in just a few minutes. By focusing on a single issue, you\u2019ll be able to address it in a better way. You can find the root cause and a way to resolve the problem.\u00a0Sales meeting tip 5 \u2013\u00a0 Allow everyone to share their success and improvements\u00a0Give everyone a few minutes to speak about their improvements and achievements since the last meeting. It doesn\u2019t necessarily need to be about closing a deal. They can speak about the positive feedback they\u2019ve received from a prospect or about increasing their appointment setting rate.The point here is to motivate them to reflect and think positively about what they\u2019ve done since the last meeting. They get a chance to ponder over their improvements and achievements. This helps in creating an environment of optimism.\u00a0Beside"

            "content": "Like a crystal ball, sales forecasting will surely not show you an exact view of the future. However, it will do give you some predictive insights into what is likely to happen in a specific time frame in context to your sales. Based on those predictive insights, you will be able to make well-informed decisions for achieving better sales outcomes.\u00a0Thus, sales forecasting is essential for any sales-driven organization. Yes, an exact view of the future isn\u2019t possible, but there needs to be some accuracy in your forecasting.Providing a forecast of $100M in revenue for next quarter to the board and delivering a $40M result leads to disappointment.\u00a0With inaccurate forecasting, you end up putting your job and reputation on the line.\u00a0While forecasting, you cannot depend on your gut on bad data; it will lead to misinformation and unmet expectations.\u00a0Unfortunately, many sales managers and reps struggle to get accurate sales forecasting results.\n79% of companies miss their sales forecast by more than 10%Just 28% of closed deals are forecasted accurately.Close amounts are off by 31% from the forecasts.When sales reps\u2019 forecasts are off, they overestimate by about $91,000 and underestimate by about $47,000.\u00a0So what can be done to turn the ship around and forecast effectively? We\u2019ve created an in-depth guide that will help you increase the accuracy level and forecast effectively.\u00a0In this blog, you will read about the following things-\nWhat is sales forecasting?\u00a0Why is sales forecasting important?Internal factors affecting sales forecasting\u00a0External factors that affect your sales forecast\u00a0Sales forecasting methods\u00a0Sales forecasting tips for the manager\u00a0Thing sales reps must-do for improving forecasting accuracyWhat is sales forecasting?\u00a0Sales forecasting is a data-focused assessment of possibilities. It is an indicator projecting the level of sales the company can expect to attain within the planned period. It is a source of valuable information that can be used to create new strategies, set targets, and identify opportunities and risks in real-time. Accurate forecasting can help a sales team function more efficiently and achieve as well as excel sales expectations.\u00a0Why is sales forecasting important?When we have a slight idea of what\u2019s ahead, we can create a course of action to achieve success. Sales forecasting leads the sales reps in the right direction. It helps in sales planning.A forecast build on a solid ground minimizes the guesswork and helps allocate resources effectively.A sales forecast even helps the financial team of a company understand how much cash will flow into a business. It gives a clearer understanding of how to use the capital and makes it possible to calculate the profit for a given period.Sales forecast helps in measuring a company\u2019s health. A company\u2019s success can be measured by how well the sales team meets the sales forecasts and contributes to revenue growth.\u00a0For instance, if the sales team is only achieving 20% of the estimated sales figure, it is a matter of concern. More efforts and performance improvements will be required to take the company on a lucrative path.\u00a0Internal factors affecting sales forecasting\u00a0Here are a few internal factors that can affect your sales forecasting.\u00a01. Changes within the organization\u00a0Internal organization changes bring a certain level of uncertainty and affect the numbers. Changes in prices, advertising, quality of products, etc. can greatly affect future sales. So if your organization is set to go through any changes, you must factor them in your forecast.\u00a02. Territory shift\u00a0When a business expands into new territory, assigns different territory to a sales rep, or a new territory management plan is introduced, there are possibilities of a temporary dip in sales. These changes will impact sales forecasting. It takes time for sales professionals to adapt to a change and adjust to the new territory. However, once they explore and familiarize themselves with a new territory, you can expect the sales to rise to an even higher point.3. Policy changes\u00a0Pay close attention to different policy changes, and even they can affect sales forecasting. Internal policies like sales promotion policy, advertising policy, pricing policy, profit policy, etc. are vital factors that influence an organization\u2019s estimated sales.Factors that affect your sales forecast\u00a0Oh! There are even a few external factors you need to pay attention to\u00a0\u00a01. Economic conditions\u00a0When the economy is strong, buyers will show interest in your product and invest in it. However, during a crisis where the economy is affected, this would seem difficult.\u00a0For instance, the 2020 COVID-19 crisis, that has crippled the global economy. Many businesses are affected due to this sudden pandemic. So, the sales forecaster must consider the general economic situation- inflation or deflation, which can affect the business favorably or adversely.\u00a0\u00a02.

            "title": "Seven tips to write sales email subject lines that boost open rates",
            "content": "Email is one of the most effective ways to reach your target audience and promote your products or services.`It\u2019s also one of the most profitable channels. With email marketing, you can expect to generate an average of $42 for every dollar you spend.That\u2019s an impressive ROI.But you can\u2019t simply blast emails to your list and expect to generate that kind of ROI. You need to craft emails that resonate with your recipients and address their pain points.Maximizing the success of your email marketing starts with your subject lines. Not sure how to craft compelling subject lines that get results?You\u2019re in the right place.In this article, we\u2019ll provide tips on how to craft subject lines for your sales emails and plenty of examples to inspire your next campaign.\u00a0But first, let us understand the importance of email subject lines.\u00a0Why Email Subject Lines Are ImportantEmail is undoubtedly an important communication channel. But the number of emails that people receive can also be overwhelming.\u00a0The number of emails sent daily is expected to reach 347 billion by 2023.\u00a0People today are incredibly busy. They don\u2019t have the time to check every single email and read through the content.That\u2019s why your subject lines are important. If you don\u2019t immediately capture your recipients\u2019 attention, they\u2019ll likely overlook your email or simply delete it altogether.\u00a0Almost half of the recipients say they open their emails based solely on the subject line. It\u2019s not an understatement to say that your subject lines could very well make or break your next email marketing campaign.One of the best ways to increase your open rates and generate more sales for your business is to write engaging email subject lines. Get this right, and email will be one of your best and most profitable website traffic sources.\u00a0Now, let\u2019s take a look at how you can improve your email subject lines, increase open rates, and generate better results with your emails.1. Personalize Your Subject LinesConsumers don\u2019t want to be treated like a number. They want to be treated as individuals.One of the best ways to increase engagement and add a more personal touch to your emails is by personalizing the subject lines. This can be as simple as using an individual\u2019s name.Recipients who receive emails with their first name in the subject line are 26% more likely to open them.\u00a0Avoid using generic statements in your subject lines like \u201cThanks for subscribing!\u201d or \u201cClick here to buy now\u201d as they seem rather impersonal.Here\u2019s an example of how Converse personalizes their emails to include each subscriber\u2019s first name in the subject line:Using the recipient\u2019s first name along with a discount makes this email more likely to stand out in their inbox.People respond when you use their first name. Use that to your advantage with your email marketing campaigns.\u00a0You can use Salesmate to easily personalize your subject lines and even the body of your email.Personalized Subject Line Examples:\n\u201c[First name], check out these hand-picked offers just for you\u201d\u201cDo you have 5 minutes to jump on a call [first name]?\u201d\u201c[First name], here\u2019s the free ebook you requested\u201d2. Keep Your Subject Lines ShortConsumers receive tons of emails everyday, so they\u2019re making snap judgments on which emails to open and which ones to send to the trash.Keep your subject lines short and get straight to the point. How long should your subject lines be?The optimal length appears to be between 6 to 10 words, which has a 21% open rate. Subject lines with 0 to 5 words have a 16% open rate, followed by 14% for 11 to 15 words and 12% to 16 to 20 words.(Image Source)Based on the data above, 6 to 10 words appear to be the sweet spot.Another reason to keep your subject lines short is that 46% of all emails are opened and read on mobile devices. Subject lines that are too long will be automatically truncated depending on the user\u2019s device.Here\u2019s an example of an email I received with a truncated subject line:I\u2019m only able to see the entire subject line when I open it up.As you keep the length of your subject line in mind, it\u2019s important to write optimized copy to entice your recipients to open your emails. One way to do that is to convey a clear benefit or focus on a pain point.Short Subject Line Examples:\u00a0\n\u201cResources to help with [pain point]\u201d\u201c[First name], want to learn more about [solution]?\u201d\u201cA special discount just for you [first name]\u201d3. Create a Sense of UrgencyHow you perceive a product depends on its availability.\u00a0If a product has a large supply available, you likely won\u2019t be in a rush to buy it. You know there\u2019s plenty of stock, so you can purchaseit on your next shopping trip.But if there\u2019s a limited supply of something you want, you\u2019ll likely be out your door in the next 10 minutes (or even sooner).Creating a sense of urgency is one principle that you can leverage in your subject lines to get recipients to act. Highlighting scarcity is one of the principles of persuasion by Robert Cialdini, a professor of psychology and"

            "content": "Sales representatives are critical to the growth of any business. They serve as a principal point of contact between the business and its customers. Sales reps ensure that current customers have the right products, identify new sales leads, and pitch to prospects. For being a successful sales rep, there are certain skills you need to develop over time.\u00a0As a first-time sales rep, you need to develop your sales skill and follow proven sales strategies to make you better at selling.\u00a0In this article, we would be looking at ten best selling tips for first-time sales reps. These tips would serve as a foundation to help you build a successful sales career.\u00a0Let\u2019s get started.Get in-depth knowledge of the products you are sellingUnderstand the pain points of the customerSell to the right peopleClose more deals with team sellingShadow a peerConduct call reviewsPractice your soft skills\u200eKnow when to walk awayFollow upLearn how to handle sales rejection1. Get in-depth knowledge of the products you are sellingProduct knowledge is essential, regardless of the industry you are in. With consumers having direct access to the internet and knowing more than ever, sales reps must know their products in and out.\u00a0Research shows that 50% of customers are looking for expert advice when making purchase decisions, while a further 73% say product knowledge is what they need most from a sales representative. This level of expectation from customers means that sales reps need to have extensive knowledge of the products they are selling.\u00a0Basic knowledge of the product isn\u2019t enough. Sales reps need to know every single detail about the product.\u00a0When a prospect asks a sales rep about any detail of a product, the sales rep should be able to give an answer quickly. The only way a sales rep can confidently answer prospect questions in real-time is if they have a thorough understanding of the product.\u00a0Sales reps should know everything about a product, including:\u00a0Price: Sales reps need to know the cost of the product they are selling. This would include cost variations depending on packages and features.\u00a0ROI: Sales reps need to know the ROI a product can bring for the customer. For example, in a sales pitch, sales reps can use statistics like, \u201cOur enterprise customers see an 80% increase in customer engagement within the first three months of using our software.\u201cCustomizations: Sales reps need to understand how to customize a product to meet different customers\u2019 needs. For example, if you sell software, the sales reps should be able to explain how startups, enterprises, and even small businesses can use the software.\u00a0Does it work? This is a question that sales reps should expect to face daily. Sales reps need to be armed with case studies that show the effectiveness of the product.\u00a0Knowledge of technical issues: A sales rep should also have basic knowledge of technical questions that customers might ask. For example, \u201chow often should I expect developer updates?\u201cProduct road mapping: Sales team should have an idea of the new products or features that would be coming out in the next few months. Good knowledge of the business marketing mix can help convince customers that need an extra push.\u00a02. Understand the pain points of the customerEffective salespeople spend time with prospects that have problems their products can solve.\u00a0If the prospects you approach do not have any pain points, they have no need for your product or service. And without need, it would be difficult to convince them to make a purchase. It\u2019s then up to the sales rep to learn how they can quickly uncover the customer\u2019s pain points.\u00a0First, what are customer pain points?A pain point is a specific problem that your Company\u2019s potential buyer is experiencing.\u00a0Pain points can be grouped into four broad categories. They are:Financial pain points: The prospect is spending too much money on their current provider or product and wants to reduce spending.\u00a0Productivity pain points: The prospect is wasting too much time before getting solutions with their current provider and wants to increase their productivity.Process pain points: The prospect wants to improve the internal processes of their businesses. For example, qualifying leads before moving them down the sales funnel.Support pain points: The prospect isn\u2019t happy with the support they are getting from their current provider or product.With these pain points, you can determine the best way to approach every customer. For example, if your prospect\u2019s main pain point is financing, you can position your own product as having a cheaper monthly subscription plan with the same benefits as their current provider.To effectively understand the pain points of prospects, you need to ask relevant questions. Here are some questions you can ask to help you identify the prospect\u2019s pain points:\u00a0What\u2019s the biggest inhibitor to your growth? (This is a general pain point question for any kind of prospect)What does your boss obsess about? (This is a pai"

            "content": "A dried-up sales pipeline is an unpleasant sight that most sales reps dread. Several sales managers and reps are aware of the buzzword \u201csales pipeline\u201d. However, most of them do not pay attention to it and manage it effectively. Sadly without a healthy pipeline achieving sales goals becomes a more challenging task.\u00a0It is easy to panic about dropping numbers, but very few sales professionals put in efforts to understand and manage the sales pipeline effectively. They are the ones who succeed in sales.\u00a0\u201cSuccess is the sum of efforts repeated day in and day out. \u2013 Robert Collier\u00a0Gaining control over the sales pipeline can make goal attainment a stress-free process.

What is the sales pipeline?Before we delve deeper into the sales pipeline\u2019s various aspects, let\u2019s first understand-what is a sales pipeline?\u00a0A sales pipeline is a visual representation of the sales process. It is a systematic way of navigating stages within a sales process.A pipeline visualizes the lifecycle of potential buyers from the initial contact to the closing stage. It shows the sales team where their potential prospects are in the buying process.\u00a0\u00a0The probability of a deal closing is directly linked with the outcome of each stage of the sale pipeline.The conversion success is dependent on the proficiency of the sales reps in managing and passing the deals through various stages of the sales pipeline CRM.\u00a02. Sales pipeline vs. sales funnel \u2013 what is the differenceYou won\u2019t find much difference in the stages of a sales pipeline and a sales funnel. However, a sales pipeline focuses on the value, quantity, and stages of the deal. While the sales funnel communicates the volume of the deals in total and the percentage of those that have successfully flown through various stages of the sales process.\u00a0A\u00a0 sales pipeline makes it easier to track deals that might take longer to progress. So, companies with a high-value product having a long and complicated sales process use a sales pipeline. While companies having a shorter sales cycle find sales funnel as a better fit for their sales teams.\u00a03. What do you need to build an effective sales pipelineIf you do not sow a seed in the right way, you might not get the expected results. The same is the case with the sales pipeline. You need to build it in the right way.\u00a0Below are the things that are essential for building an effective sales pipeline.\u00a0A list of prospectsBefore anything else, first, focus on having a list of prospects. A high-quality lead list is requisite. It should be a proper list of people who want to buy from, or people you think will buy from you.\u00a0Try to make it as detailed as possible.It should have full names, phone number, email-id, the prospect\u2019s company name, work position, and how they connect with you.\u00a0Either the marketing team can help you create the list or outsource them from a digital marketing agency.\u00a0However, make sure the list\u2019s prospects meet the criteria set in the ideal buyer\u2019s profile.A clear buyer persona\u00a0Having a clear buyer persona can save a lot of time. It will prevent you from wasting your precious hours on chasing the leads that won\u2019t convert into sales. So, before you think about building a sales pipeline, invest some time creating a clear buyer persona.\u00a0What is a buyer persona?Well, it is a representation of your ideal customer. It embodies a buyer\u2019s characteristics that give the most revenue, with the least opposition over the longest period.\u00a0So, how to create a buyer persona?Well, here\u2019s how you can do it.\u00a0\nLook through your sales history (You can even take the help of a CRM software)\u00a0Create a list of satisfied customers.\u00a0Narrow down the most common traits and pain points.Once you collect the information of the ideal buyer, commence developing the buyer persona.Be explicit while describing your ideal buyer.Map the entire buyer\u2019s journey.

Have a good product and market knowledgeProspect: So, can I even auto-assign order to the vendors using your product?Sales: I am not sure.

Besides, you might come across prospects who are rude and hot-headed. However, whatever is the circumstances, you need to stay calm and positive.\u00a0\u201cThe moment you\u2019re ready to quit is usually the moment before a miracle happens.

            "content": "Every sales rep wishes to enter the best company that offers great incentives and employee perks. However, getting an entry ticket by cracking the sales interview isn\u2019t a walk in the park. The sales job interview questions often send chills down one\u2019s spine. Most sales reps get nervous and bungle even the most basic sales questions.Well, the problem is several salespeople go for an interview without preparation, which is why most of them don\u2019t succeed.\u00a0By preparing for the sales interview questions sales reps can conquer the nerve and ace the interview.Most common interview questions for sales reps\u00a0Free yourself from anxiety by preparing before going for a sales interview. Often you\u2019ll face similar kinds of questions in a sales job interview. So make a list of commonly asked sales questions and prepare the answer.\u00a0To help you, I\u2019ve listed a few questions below along with the answers:1. Can you tell me a bit about yourself?Well, here the interviewer isn\u2019t interested in knowing your personal or professional life story. They want to see, how well you can pitch and how confident you are in presenting yourself. Be brief and highlight your strengths as well as achievements in sales. However, make sure you speak the truth. Give real-life examples\u00a0Possible Answer\u00a0I am an avid learner and a problem solver. I am quite good at relationship building which is why I chose sales as a career. I like to interact with new people and learn about their businesses as well as challenges. Due to my strong interpersonal skills, I am able to help potential prospects visualize and believe how a simple product can make their work as well as life easier. This is why many prospects purchased the product I sold and even mentioned me in their positive reviews.2. How do you handle rejection?Rejection is a hurdle that every salesperson faces in their sales career. Some are not able to handle rejections and companies don\u2019t prefer hiring such hot-headed individuals. So present yourself as a calm person who takes rejection as a challenge and works harder.\u00a0Possible Answer\u00a0Rejection is part of professional selling and I am mentally prepared to face it. Many will say \u201cNO\u201d, I expect that. everyone doesn\u2019t have the budget or requirement to purchase the product. In fact, I look at rejection as an opportunity to get better. I listen to my recorded sales calls and check if at all I\u2019ve made any mistakes. I even prepare a good response when I hear a \u201cNo\u201d so that I can handle a similar rejection in the future.\u00a03. How comfortable are you with making cold calls?Cold calling is the best way to connect with new opportunities. However, sadly few salespeople get bored dialing numbers and connecting with people they\u2019ve never spoken to before. They get anxious and blank. Well, cold calling is an art that needs to be mastered. It isn\u2019t just about dialing random numbers, it is about establishing relationships and you need to convey that you understand this.Possible Answer\u00a0I am an extrovert who enjoys speaking to different individuals. So, cold calling is something that makes me happy. Besides I am blessed with a great sense of humor that helps in breaking the ice and making the prospect comfortable. However, I don\u2019t jump for quantity, I am interested in quality. So, I just make a few calls a day but they are effective as I do my research before calling to strike up a meaningful conversation with the potential buyer.\u00a04. In your last position, how did you balance maintaining current relationships and converting new deals?Both new clients, as well as current customers, are important for a business and they would like to hire someone who can handle both efficiently. So, make the interviewer believe that you are a smart player. You can keep the current customers happy as well as nurture a deal and convert it into sales.Possible Answer\u00a0I am a tech-savvy person. I used most of the popular sales apps to increase my productive hours and efficiency to give time to both potential buyer and current customers. For instance, by creating sequences of emails in a CRM I used to put the follow-up on autopilot and connect with the potential buyer in real time. On the other hand, with the help of a form builder and survey app, I use it to quickly create a survey for the current customer to take their feedback for understanding if they are happy with the product. These apps reduced my workload so I could balance both relationships efficiently.\u00a05. What are the core values every salesperson must-have?\u00a0There are certain sales skills that are required to persuade a prospect and convert them into paying customers. It is necessary to be aware of these sales skills and assure the interviewer that you have these sales skills.\u00a0Possible AnswerIn my 3 years of experience in sales, there are few of important sales skills that helped me convert many potential buyers into paying customers.So I feel every sales reps should possess these skills-\u00a0\nActive listeningPersistenceNetworking skillsCollabora"

            "content": "Often there comes the point in sales when you feel emotionally drained and stuck at a single place with no hopes to move ahead.\u00a0You feel engulfed with negativity. Even simple sales tasks feel like a dramatic undertaking.\u00a0\u00a0You aren\u2019t able to focus.You don\u2019t have enough energy to be consistently productive.\u00a0Suddenly the sales quota that you were able to achieve earlier now seems like an albatross around the neck.Well, these are all the classic signs of \u201cSales Burnout\u201d.\u00a0What is sales burnout?\u00a0Sales burnout is the conglomeration of mental, physical, and emotional reactions in response to prolonged stress. It happens over a slow period. You might experience it when there is a disconnect between what you are currently doing and what you truly want to do or when things change for the worse.\u00a0Sales burnout hurts: It can take a serious toll on your performance as well as your health.\u00a0Chronic stress, insomnia, unhappiness, anger, exasperation, restlessness, high blood pressure, vulnerability to illness, poor sales results, etc. are some of the consequences of sales burnout.\u00a0Salesburnout can happen to the best of us. If you are aware and take action in real-time, you can also recover.\u00a0Beating the sales burnout \u2013 Steps to recover\u00a0In sales burnout, you feel you have little or no control over your work. Suddenly everything starts piling up, and you keep losing interest. You become irritable and impatient. You are not able to manage your sales activities, deals, prospects, and clients. You withdraw from new responsibilities. Your routine work is affected, which has a grievous impact on your sales goals.Instead of hitting the pause button and hoping you could escape from a sales burnout, it is better to do something to change it actively.\u00a0Here are a few things you can do to recover from a sales burnout.1. Plan out your each workday\u00a0During a sales burnout, you lose track of time. You just work for the sake of working, and so most of the tasks aren\u2019t completed. You even end up losing deals due to constant delays.\u00a0Lack of direction, not lack of time, is the problem. We all have twenty-four hour days.The first thing you need to do is systematically gain control over your time and plan each day.\u00a0Invest a little time in structuring your day. Make a list of things that you need to do in a day. Prioritize your tasks.Remove tasks that are not important or can be handled differently. For instance, instead of drafting the same email repeatedly, create and reuse email templates.\u00a0Start with the tasks that are difficult and time-consuming. Allot time for each task. Track them and ensure you are completing them on-time. Be true to yourself; you will remain stuck in the vicious circle of disappointment.\u00a02. Actively seek mentorship\u00a0When in trouble, do not hesitate to approach your senior or manager. Their knowledge and experience can save you from drowning. However, you need to be open to constructive criticism.\u00a0When seeking\u00a0sales mentorship, ask for feedback. As you are already stressed, you might not be able to see the gap in your performance. So take help and ask them to evaluate your performance. Work sincerely on improvement areas. You, seniors, can show you the path to success, but it is you who have to travel to reach there.\u00a0There has to be a willingness to constantly accept critical feedback and rapidly iterate to make things better. \u2013 Sam Yagan\u00a0Keep communicating with your seniors. They might give you some valuable advice to get through the rough patch. They can save you from getting trapped in negativity.\u00a0\u00a03. Take help from some sales tools to reduce your workload\u00a0During a sales burnout, you feel you are overloaded with work. Well, the reality is you just need to streamline your work, get things organized, and take the smart route to get things done quickly.\u00a0You\u2019ll find many sales tools in the market that can help you with it. For instance, with a smart tool like Salesmate CRM, you can easily manage your sales contacts, activities, and deals as well as automate most of the time-consuming tasks.\u00a0Or\u00a0With a tool like Proposify, create professional-looking proposals in minutes. You can easily store all the important content, photo, and logos in their content library and use them whenever required.\u00a0Such sales tools help you in managing your work efficiently and even increases your productive hours.\u00a0To find more such helpful tools you can refer to the blog \u201c50 Best Marketing\u00a0 And Sales Tools To Look In 2023\u201d4.

You just need to be aware of it and address the burnout before it is too late. You start feeling restless and fatigue. You get tired as well as irritated quickly. You just want to stop and rest.\u00a0Well, don\u2019t neglect these signs. Give attention to this stressful state. Try to meditate and calm yourself.

Let me rephrase this sentence.\u00a0With the help of \u201cEffective\u201d sales emails, you can grab the attention of potential prospects, engage them, and increase your conversion rate.Bland, no-salt-added sales emails often hit the thrash in seconds.\u00a0Email communication is requisite at every stage of the sales process. However, if the first few emails aren\u2019t compelling enough to get responses, you won\u2019t get a chance to send emails during the later stages of the sales process.\u00a0You\u2019ve just got a few minutes to impress the prospects.

So make sure your emails are worth their time.\u00a051% of recipients delete emails within the first few seconds of opening it.Wondering how to draft effective emails that get responses? Read on!Things to consider while sending sales emailsThink about the low-quality emails you\u2019ve received. Weren\u2019t they annoying? I am sure you wouldn\u2019t want your prospects to feel the same.\u00a0Email is a truly powerful tool if used in the right way.\u00a0Email is 40 times more effective at acquiring new customers than Facebook or Twitter.\u00a0Here are things you mush consider while sending sales emails during different stages of the sales pipeline.\u00a01. Embrace personalizationA one-size-fits-all approach repels modern buyers. If the message isn\u2019t personalized, it will fail to capture the potential buyer\u2019s interest.\u00a0Personalization humanizes communication and helps in establishing a relationship with the potential prospect.\u00a0So, invest time in personalizing your emails. Go beyond just names and include points that your potential buyer would love to read.\u00a0Being a sales professional with a long to-do list, you might find it time-saving to use sales email templates, which is actually a smart thing to do. However, ensure you personalize the message before sending it.\u00a02. Get to the point immediately\u00a0Time is money. So, don\u2019t beat around the bush. Get to the point right away. Only include information that is important, keep the content of the sales email short and precise.\u00a0Focus on the message that you want the potential buyers to act upon. Nobody has time to wade through a lengthy email to figure out what you want. A bulleted list can be helpful here.\u00a03. Use the right tone, words, phrases\u00a0Using the appropriate tone is of paramount importance while drafting sales emails.\u00a0Each word carries a tone and significance. So, be careful with the words you choose while drafting a sales email. The entire tone of a sales email can change if your emphasis changes from \u201cI\u201d to \u201cYou\u201d.Avoid jargon, colloquialism, and complicated phrases. Don\u2019t fill your email with superlatives like \u201cbrilliant,\u201d \u201cunbelievable,\u201d \u201cbrand-new,\u201d \u201cseamless,\u201d etc.\u00a0\u00a0Keep your email content simple and easy to understand.\u00a0\u00a0Do not include negative words like:\nNeverUnavoidable\u00a0BadDelayFailureNeglectIrresponsible\u00a0Uncertain\u00a0Even pay attention to the phrases used in the sales emails.\u00a0Here are a few phrases that you should avoid using\u00a0\n\u201cThis is the perfect product for your company\u201dYes, your product can help the customer, but do not overstate your case.\nOur product has excellent features like \u201cA, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J\u2026\u201dPotential buyers are not interested in knowing how great is your product; they want to know how it can resolve their current problem.\u00a0\n\u201cTo whomsoever it concern\u201d\u00a0As I said above, personalization is a must while sending sales emails. This appears as if the emails are sent to 100 people.\u00a0\n\u201cSorry if I\u2019ve wasted your time\u201dThis phrase can create a negative impression on the prospect. Sales reps are expected to provide value at every point in the sales process. So, avoid setting the wrong tone where the prospect might feel they are wasting their precious time.\u00a0\n\u201cCan you do me a favor?\u201dWhoa! Asking a favor before providing value to the prospect is a big no-no.\u00a04. Choose the right time to send the emails\u00a0The chances of getting a response will plummet if your email goes at the wrong hour. So be extra careful while selecting the time and day to send your sales emails.\u00a0Most sales professionals dread the Monday blues and lazy Friday. So, they often choose Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday to send an email.\u00a0Analyze your past emails sent to satisfied customers and check at what time and day did most of them respond.\u00a0Pick the same date and time to approach potential prospects. See if it is working. If not, then change your approach. Each client is different, so you need to keep experimenting to see what works best.\u00a05. Keep tracking your emails\u00a0It is necessary to know what happened to your email after your hit send. Did the prospect open and read it? Or were your emails ignored?\u00a0Well, to find that out your need to track your sales emails. It is necessary to measure the effectiveness of your outbound emails.

For instance, while going through the prospect\u2019s social media profile, you find a mutual connection, you can speak about them to the prospect. On LinkedIn, you can follow the prospect and see their recent activities. This will help you in understanding their areas of interest that you can discuss during the call.\u00a02. Analyze the needs by asking questions\u00a0Once you make the prospect a little comfortable, try to discover their needs. Try to find what fear, concerns, or problems are they facing. What are their requirements and goals?Questioning is an integral part of need-based selling. You need to ask relevant questions to the prospect.\u00a0Below are a few examples of needs-based selling questions\u00a0What are your short-term and long-term goals?What\u2019s holding you back from achieving those goals?\u00a0\u00a0Can you elaborate on your current problem?\u00a0Since when have you been facing this problem?Have you done anything in the past to address this problem?How much is the problem costing you in terms of time, money, resources, and energy?What\u2019s the root cause of the problem?\u00a0How long can you have the problem go unresolved?Why have you been dealing with this problem for so long?\u00a0Besides this, are there any other problems that you are facing?\u00a0How are those problems affecting your business?\u00a0Are there any long term effects of these problems?Are these problems affecting your current customers?How much more productive would your team be if this problem did not exist?What kind of returns are you looking for, if you get a solution to these problems?Are there any specific things that you are looking for in a solution?What is your buying criteria?Are there other areas we haven\u2019t cornered that are important to you?\u00a0Make sure you listen to your prospects while asking these questions. Pay attention to their answers. Use the best CRM that comes with a built-in phone system. So, along with systematically managing the prospect data, you can even handle the calls, record them, and add notes about essential details in the CRM. You can listen to this recording later to collect information that you might have missed while the prospect was answering your questions.\u00a03. Summarize and confirm\u00a0Repeat whatever the prospect has shared with you. While you summarize the needs, there are chances that the prospect might remember a few more needs that they might have forgotten to share.Besides, summarizing the needs helps in making a good impression on the prospect. It shows that you have listened and understood the prospect\u2019s need. Even if you\u2019ve misunderstood any point, it can be cleared out at the right time.\u00a04. Offer solution\u00a0Once you know what the prospect wants, show them how your product can help in achieving it. You need to smartly present your product as a solution to the prospect\u2019s problems.\u00a0Help them visualize the benefits they will receive o"

            "title": "The fear of cold calling: 5 precise tips to get over it",
            "content": "\u201cCold calling\u201d is one of the sales tasks that most salespeople wish to skip.\u00a0Why?\u00a0Well, because it is the first contact with a prospect who has no prior knowledge about the call.\u00a0Most sales professionals dread that first interaction with the prospect as they have no clue how the prospect would react to the cold call. They fear that the call will end in rejection, or they might infuriate the prospects by disturbing them.\u00a048% of sales are afraid to make cold calls.Cold calling is an old but one of the most effective ways of reaching new opportunities.\u00a0Even the brain behind Uber, Travis Kalanick, found his first few customers through cold calling.\u00a0Quoting Travis Kalanick (Founder of Uber) \u2013\u00a0\u201cI went to Google, typed in San Francisco chauffeur or San Francisco limousine, I just filled out an excel sheet, and I just started dialing for dollars, right? The first ten guys I called, three of them hung up before I got a few words out, a few of them would listen for like 45 seconds and then hung up, and three of them said, \u2018I\u2019m interested, let\u2019s meet.\u2019. And if you\u2019re cold calling and three out of ten say \u2018let\u2019s meet\u2019, you\u2019ve got something.\u201dWell, that just proves cold calling is effective.\u00a0So be confident as well as enthusiastic and overcome your fear of cold calling.\u00a0Fear is nothing more than a state of mind \u2013 Napoleon HillConquer the fear of cold calling\u00a0Cold calling is, without a doubt, challenging. However, if you want to reach the end destination, i.e., success, then you need to overcome the challenges that come your way.\u00a0Fear limits us; it causes anxiety, restlessness, and powerlessness. With a fearful mind, you cannot think clearly and have a meaningful conversation with the prospect.Prospecting is an essential phase of the sales process. If you succumb to fear, you won\u2019t be able to prospect successfully and ultimately fail in achieving your sales targets.\u00a0So, do not surrender to the cold calling fear.\u00a0Fear thrives in a place of inaction. Overcome your anxiety by taking one small step forward \u2013 Sarah BoydBelow are few tips to get over the cold calling fear.\u00a01. Research before you dial the prospect\u2019s number\u00a0We often get nervous when we have to speak to a stranger. To establish a rapport, you need to know who you are calling. So make sure you invest a little time in gathering necessary information about the prospect.You can quickly get the necessary information about your prospect through social media sites. Follow their post to find out their interest. Check if you two have any mutual connection.You can even study the prospect\u2019s company website to understand what they do. This might appear as a tedious task, but it helps in breaking the ice.\u00a0You are more confident when you know about the prospects. The information about the prospect helps in striking a meaningful conversation.\u00a0Besides, it even creates a good impression on the prospect that you\u2019ve done your research before calling them.So make sure you do not call without researching the prospect.\u00a02. Have a plan\u00a0\u00a0Often sales reps go blank during cold calls. This is because most of them don\u2019t plan.\u00a0Planning is crucial to get over the fear of cold calling.\u00a0Proper planning and preparation prevents poor performance \u2013 Stephen Keague\u00a0Once you do your research, plan what all you need to cover during the cold call.\u00a0What questions will you ask?What message do you need to convey?\u00a0What will be the opening sentence?What will be the closing statement?\u00a0With the help of planning, you\u2019ll know what to say next to engage the prospects and keep them on the call for a longer duration.\u00a03. Identify what are you afraid of\u00a0Many thoughts might stop you from making the cold call. So, analyze and make a list of fears that are holding you back from making a cold call.\u00a0\u00a0Are you afraid that you might call the prospects at the wrong hour?\u00a0\u00a0Or\u00a0They will say, \u201cthey are not interested.\u201d\u00a0Or\u00a0You can\u2019t articulate your thoughts when you are speaking to a stranger.\u00a0Well, there is always a way to overcome the fear if you address rather than ignoring it.\u00a0For instance, if you are scared about calling the prospect at the wrong hour. Then research and find out the best time to make a sales call.Even if you call at the wrong time, apologize, and take a convenient time to call. Do get disappointed if the prospect doesn\u2019t respond in an appropriate way. Stay calm, and do not let it affect the next call. If you are upset, you won\u2019t be able to have a proper conversation with the next prospects who might show interest in what you are selling.\u00a0You cannot afford to miss any opportunity in sales, so you should prepare yourself to handle every kind of criticism and rejection. Even if the prospect says he is not interested. Do not give up easily. Ask for a reason, explain how youtube helped other businesses in the prospect\u2019s industry and how you can help them too.\u00a04. Practice with the help of mock calls\u00a0Practice makes a man perfect. You need to practice to master the art of cold calling.\u00a0Practice creates confidence. Co"

Everybody has that. It is the will to prepare to win that is important \u2013 Bobby Knight.Action plan for improving sales performance\u00a0A thought is incomplete without action. Just thinking that \u201cI want to improve my sales performance\u201d wouldn\u2019t help.Improving your sales performance is a goal; now, you need a plan of action to reach that goal.\u00a0Here are some useful recommendations that can help you in creating a sales action plan for\u00a0improving your sales performance,1. Set short term priorities and establish a plan\u00a0Most of the sales reps set priorities for the year. By the time they reach the end of the year, half are forgotten, and rest are carried forward to the next year.So don\u2019t go too far.Set priorities for 90 days. Find out the top things that need your attention.\u00a0If you want to improve your sales, your high-value deals should be in your top priority list. If they slip through the crack, you might miss out on lucrative opportunities.\u00a0Take a look at your sales pipeline and make a list of all the high-value deals.Create a plan of how you will close these deals.\u00a0Refer to similar deals that you\u2019ve closed in the past to find out which approach worked and can be used to close the current deals.2. Create a weekly to-do list\u00a0In sales, you need to stay organized and focused. Create a sales action plan for what you will do for the entire week.\u00a0Plan it strategically and invest your time in the tasks that contribute to your sales.\u00a0Play smart and automate the rest of the time-consuming tasks. Using the best CRM, you can automate tasks like sending a follow-up email or assigning tasks to teammates.\u00a0You can even add activities of the week in a CRM that will be visible on the dashboard. This will reduce your chances of missing out on any activity. Most of the best CRM also gives you a calendar view of your tasks and appointments. So, you can easily plan and follow a schedule for the week.\u00a03. Note down your Greatest impact activity\u00a0You need to identify your Greatest Impact Activity(GIA) and focus on it with unwavering determination. GIA is the one crucial activity that gives you the highest return on your time investment when done consistently\u00a0By finding your GIA and completing it with utmost sincerity, you make strides toward the success you are endeavoring for.\u00a0GIA is rarely the easiest activity of the list. However, being the most important, one it shouldn\u2019t be avoided. For instance, making 35 prospecting touches each day or reaching out to prospects who haven\u2019t responded in the past. GIA can help you move a deal forward to reach sales goals if done regularly. Make sure you find out the most important activities that you need to put first to reach your goal.\u00a04. Identify the best selling time\u00a0Most sales reps call or send an email at any hour of the day, so they don\u2019t get a response from the prospect.Whether you are selling over the phone or using email to nurture and convert the prospect, ensure you choose the right time to call or send emails.\u00a0Even your prospects are busy. They might not be available at certain hours of the day. So, avoid connecting with them during those hours; this will even help in saving your time.\u00a0Put in little effort to find out the best time to call or send emails. Check the call logs to see when the prospect responded and how long did the call last.\u00a0Check if the prospect has responded to your emails in the past. If yes, then check the time when those emails were sent.\u00a0Research on the internet, too, for finding the best time to call and send an email.\u00a0As per the data provided by CoSchedule, 10 am, is the best time to send an email.\u00a0At Salesmate, we conducted a study to find the best time to call the prospect. After observing 12,480 calls spanned across 60 days, we found that 4 to 5 in the evening is the best time to call a prospect.5. Analyze your weak points and plan steps to overcome the weakness\u00a0You need to find where you are going wrong. Why aren\u2019t you able to close deals?\u00a0Till you don\u2019t find out your mistakes, you cannot improve. So, analyze past sales.

            "content": "With over 25 million layoffs prediction, the invisible enemy has struck where it hurts organizations the most. This pandemic has left the sales fraternity asking various questions.\nHow to protect the field-sales culture ticking and productive?What is the future of sales?The real issue is that every day is different, with a rising number in cases, and the rules to curb the spread have left companies no other options but to close the shop or view alternatives to function at a break-even.In these trying times, what can be done to maintain the influx of money and keep the current customer base acquired? After all, you cannot just lose them after spending \u201cdollars\u201d in the marketing campaigns, can you?While the world is struggling with ostrich syndrome, sales leaders need to think of the strategies that will amplify their efforts and keep the revenue cycle alive; your business\u2019s future depends on it.With the whole work from home schedule, the impact is on the socializing animal inside human beings. The daily interaction with team members and higher authorities and the sense of accomplishment is being missed with the haphazard schedule that comes with remote working.This pandemic has changed everything, starting from the physical presence of team members in the daily meetings to the discussions of various strategies over a quick cup of coffee or lunch!Times like these define, build, and reinforce relationships be it with your audience or with your team members. When it comes to keeping the motivation level of your team members high, it is important to reach out to them via video conferencing or a video message.When it comes to dealing with your customers and prospects your sales reps must position themselves as a trusted resource. This can be done by demonstrating respect and sensitivity toward your contacts.In this article, we are listing out seven tips for maintaining a winning sales culture during a pandemic. So, let\u2019s get on with it!1. Avoiding hand-shakes\u201cNamaste; the new handshake!\u201dYes, you read that right, the pandemic is far from being over, and even though the respective medical agencies have given permission to work with relatively lesser staff, you might want to avoid handshakes. Yes, in the pre-Covid 19 times, it was a major custom, but in the wake of this pandemic, many things have been tossed out of the \u201csocializing\u201d dictionary. Handshake is one of them.And do not worry, your customer won\u2019t think negatively if you do not greet them with a handshake. They will know that their health and safety is one of your priorities. There are many other ways of showing your gratitude to the client, a slight bow, a tip of the hat, or a virtual hello (high five) will also do.2. Having a work buddyBeing a remote worker is not an easy task. You are not just an employee but you are also balancing the household chores-meeting-productivity cycle! And yes, you miss the hallway, cafeteria, and water station small talk with your office colleagues. This is where your virtual conversations with fellow teammates come in.Yes, the new world order is too isolated, but thanks to technological advances you can manage the relationship with your coworkers using professional tools like Google Meets, Chat, Slack, Mattermost, and much more.It is not just limited to one person, you can loop in many coworkers to be your work buddy and stay motivated while you are carrying out the tasks. Keep the communication cultural norms intact and reduce the negative feelings that isolation brings.3. Using video conferencing90% of respondents say video makes it easier to get their point across \u2013 lifesizeTrain your sales reps to be presentable and cordial with the prospects and customers over the video call. It is a much more attractive option during the pandemic. It is even more important than your general phone call because now you are making a phone call to book an appointment. The video call is your appointment. Phew! One step struck out from the sales stages!4. Leveraging the remote work toolsYour remote work tool stack is looking good these days. You have a combination of everything, tools for keeping a tab on your sales pipeline, customer communication, team inbox, video chat tools, and even your phone.\u00a0\u00a0Reading your prospect or customers\u2019 reaction can be a challenge for sales reps on virtual meetings (yeah, you won\u2019t be getting an outstanding bandwidth while you are home with other members of the family who are on the same wi-fi network as you!)Start listening to every minute details that are shared by the customer or prospect over the video call. It can be \u2018a nudge\u2019, \u2018a grunt\u2019, \u2018a sigh of relief\u2019, etc. Make sure that you understand the prospect or customer\u2019s view and needs before taking the communication to other mediums.5. Adding value to interactionsIt is not just you that has to adapt to the new norms of living in a post-covid 19 world, your prospects, buyers, suppliers, and customers also are doing the same. They are busy too!Recognize the"

Sales \u2013 is the world giving sleepless nights to millions of people around the globe. Organizations across the world invest a lot of time, effort, and resources into the development of marketing strategies and innovating services and products.\u00a0Coaching the sales reps is one of the most trusted sales leadership ideas. Take a look at the following screenshot to have an idea of the kind of efforts that are invested in boosting sales.\u00a0Image SourceBut the efficacy of even such sales leadership programs depends upon:\nThe willingness of the professionals to learnThe kind of stats, data, and insights covered in the coaching programDoing all the above-mentioned things to boost your sales is essential \u2013 but they all live or die by what happens when a seller meets a buyer.\u00a0It\u2019s just that it is rare to see businesses across all sectors work on their brand. All they actually care about is sales. But the same business owners forget that if they have a brand image, then they\u2019ll surely reach their sales target too.\u00a0The reality is that the biggest brands in the world never sell themselves. They brand their products and services. The best example is Apple. The company never told people to buy their phones or laptops. It showed them how great it would be to own an Apple product. It offered glimpses of photos, videos, and other accomplishments an iPhone owner can enjoy. Their ads brand an entire experience for the users and tell the customers what kinds of joy owning an Apple product can bring.\u00a0Similar is the case with Pepsico. As per the global brand expert, Kevin Keller, the brand has a tangible book value of 6.5 billion US dollars. But its market value surpasses 90 billion US dollars. Of this huge amount, 83 billion US dollars are attributed to the intangible assets of the brand i.e. brand equity.\u00a0So, building a brand is of consequence when it comes to discussing the future of sales leadership. Especially in the times when 73% of customers use more than one channel while purchasing some product.\u00a0In this article, we aim to help readers learn how they can work on the next big idea in sales leadership \u2013 brand building.Before we explore the best ways of building a brand, let us find out what makes it one of the most crucial sales leadership ideas.\u00a0Why is brand building the new sales leadership idea?Customers today are well-informed and have no dearth of options. They might fill their online shopping carts and then return back to the research phase without making a purchase.\u00a0So, the traditional sales funnel approach is an outdated model that doesn\u2019t cut out in the current scenario. The journey of a customer from one phase of purchase to another has become non-linear and fast. Further, the amount of information to be considered has increased considerably.\u00a0Want more proof? Take a look at the coverage on the failure of brands to deliver personalized experiences to their customers. 75% of customers purchase products from a brand that knows them and their purchase history.\u00a0Hence, if your destination is boosting sales trends, then brand awareness is the shortest path!Now that we have agreed upon the importance of brand building for sales conversion let us find out the best practices to establish your brand.7 practices to help you establish your brandCheck out these 7 solid practices to establish your brand:1. Help sales leaders develop strong skillsAs per the studies, Nike took 14 years to hit the $100M sales mark. Lululemon took 9 years to reach there, and UnderArmour took 8. And surprisingly, Dollar Shave Club, Casper, and ClassPass hit the mark in just 3 years!Apart from the bevy of other factors that played a key role in defining this timeline, there is one thing that stands out \u2013 training the Sales Leaders.\u00a0Back in the time, when Nike started, consumers were not informed. They didn\u2019t have access to high-speed internet and smart digital devices to explore other options and choose. Thus, the job of sales and marketing professionals was easier.\u00a0As time progressed, the competition got fierce, and customers became the single-most entity driving sales trends. This called for coaching the sales leaders on the basis of knowledge repositories formulated on the basis of previous examples and experiences.The market stats and data from all over the world helped them to come up with impressive and customer-oriented sales leadership ideas. Hence, the result!Takeaway:Having a strong coaching culture and worthwhile coaching program in place is essential to help sales leaders to develop strong skills.\u00a02. Get your support stack in placeThe future of sales leadership lies in the hands of an impeccable multi-channel customer service system.

If the marketing and sales teams work closely together, customers receive the right communications and information at the right time.\u00a0A 2010 study showed that companies with strongly integrated sales and marketing functions achieved an average of 20% annual revenue growth.And Marketing Profs found that companies that took a smarketing approach enjoyed 36% higher customer retention rates and 38% more sales wins:Source: IronpaperIf your sales and marketing teams are out of alignment or do not view each other as teammates, you can face serious issues.Without a full understanding of sales goals and how the team meets them, your marketers will not be able to focus their efforts in the right place and pull in the kind of qualified leads needed.Without understanding and having input into the marketing strategy, your salespeople will be poorly equipped to convert those leads into customers.This is not good for customer satisfaction, employee morale, or the bottom line.Therefore, embracing smarketing will allow both teams to fully utilize their skills to take your business to the next level.\u00a0 \n\nEmpower sales and marketing teams with a strong CRM!Salesmate helps you find the right balance between two teams with the right values.Start your free trial5 steps to implementing a Smarketing strategyNow that you understand the value of a smarketing approach, you might be wondering how to implement it in your business. In this section, I\u2019ll share my top tips to get you started.\u00a0Step 1: Assess your baseline and set goals\u00a0How well are your two teams working together already? Perhaps they have a reasonably healthy relationship, but the processes need some fine-tuning.Or maybe they are entirely out of alignment and require a significant overhaul.\u00a0Consider the following questions to assess what your smarketing baseline is:How often do the sales and marketing teams meet, if at all?Do meetings between the two teams tend to be collaborative or adversarial?\u00a0How often and in what ways do the two teams communicate outside of formal meetings?What is the relationship between the heads of each department?\u00a0How do the two teams speak about one another? Your answer to this should account for informal complaints or things you have heard around the office and any feedback you receive through official channels.\u00a0What percentage of the leads generated by your marketing team is typically followed up by your sales team? (If this number is low, it indicates either a problem with how leads are handed over or a problem with the follow-up process.)\u00a0What percentage of leads that are followed up result in a conversion? High follow-up but low conversions are indicative of poor-quality leads.\u00a0Once you\u2019ve established a baseline indication of how things are going, you can start to work on your smarketing strategy.Start by setting your goals. Remember that goals should be SMART: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Timely.\u201cI would like my sales and marketing teams to become more aligned\u201d is a poor goal.\u201cI would like to build stronger communication between my sales and marketing teams and see a 10% growth in revenue by the end of the year\u201d is a SMART goal.\u00a0Step 2: Get the whole team\u2019s buy-in and build smarketing into your cultureIf your approach until now has been to have separate and disparate sales and marketing teams, you cannot expect this to change overnight completely.Altering a company culture takes time and effort, but it is worth putting the work in \u2013 and the sooner you get started, the better.Any change of direction within a business can only succeed if everyone is invested in its success.Therefore, involve everyone from both teams and get their buy-in as early as possible.\u00a0Take a top-down approach, beginning with the heads of the two departments and senior executives.Getting these key people on your side will be critical to implementing the new strategy across the teams and the company.\u00a0Explain why you are shifting to a smarketing approach and the benefits it will bring.Ask everyone to voice any concerns they have, pay attention to those concerns, and do what you can to address them.If people feel that you\u2019re listening to them, they are more likely to respond positively to the changes and embrace the new approach.\u00a0One of the best ways to build a culture based around the smarketing approach is to include it as part of your onboarding process.You should include a smarketing onboarding meeting with the heads of both departments as part o"

            "content": "The great effect of the coronavirus pandemic on several industries is no longer breaking news, but businesses may have yet to experience the full force of change brought about by local lockdowns, halted operations, and an emphasis on social distancing and quarantine as the new normal.The pandemic has only sped up the transition of businesses to remote work and fully digital workflows for all teams \u2013 including, and especially, sales.\u00a0A skilled sales team knows that no matter what tools or interface, a successful sale is based on developing a strong professional relationship with the customer. So even if we can no longer meet our prospects and leads face-to-face, we can still engage with them virtually to convert them into a paying customer.Want to see how you can make the most of digital and virtual to turn leads into customers? Read on to learn the newest best industry practices for making more virtual sales.\u00a0Divide all sales presentation rules by 3\u00a0Just as people quickly scroll past posts on social media, your audience during a virtual sales call also has a much shorter attention span.\u00a0A virtual audience reportedly loses their focus after five minutes into a sales presentation. Compare that with the 15-minute attention span of a live audience and you have an even bigger challenge to deliver a captivating virtual presentation.\u00a0The rule of 3s in public speaking tells us that audiences can better retain information or concepts that are presented in groups of three. So this means: organize the presentation into three parts, deliberately repeat important points like product benefits or features, and emphasize important CTAs at least three times.\u00a0It\u2019s also a good idea to shorten your virtual presentations by cutting out excessive words from slides or using more visual cues instead.\u00a0Make sure your webcam, lighting, and microphone work for your teamIn the same way that people don\u2019t like watching low-quality videos with grainy images and unclear sound, your prospects will likely have an unpleasant experience if their sales calls with your team feature the same.\u00a0Because of this, consider investing in proper audio-visual equipment for your sales team members. Set them up for success by also teaching them to use a good light source and a high-quality microphone during calls to promote professionalism and provide great customer experiences.\u00a0Considering that this may be the new normal for a long time, you may want to offer reimbursements if sales members have to buy equipment for their home offices.This all ties in to a well-produced presentation, which makes all the difference for a successful sales campaign.\u00a0Provide value before and during the callIt\u2019s important not to waste your prospective customer\u2019s time. Before the call, do a little background research about your leads and their business, so you can position yourself as the solution they need ahead of time.\u00a0You can also offer free and valuable digital content and assets to keep them hooked and increase your chances of closing a sale when they actually get on a call with you.\u00a0Just as you get on the call, be sure to promptly and clearly explain the benefits of the call or presentation with you. Will they learn how to save time on complex processes in their business? Will they have an easier time managing their leads?The beginning of your call is a great time to glean information about your client. Then, you can use this data about them and turn them into insights right away, so you can pitch a sale and have higher chances of closing.\u00a0Make sure all sales team members have optimized social profilesAccording to a previous survey, 96% of customers enjoy engaging with brands that they follow on social media. In another study, it was found that, unsurprisingly, 72.6% of salespeople who actively use social media have better performance and productivity than their colleagues who don\u2019t use such.\u00a0And one social network you\u2019ll want your sales team on is LinkedIn.\u00a0An optimized and professional LinkedIn profile, complete with a quality network, can help your sales or marketing team members generate better-targeted leads, conduct more effective outreach campaigns, and close more virtual sales.\u00a0Each member of your sales and marketing team must craft a strong, active, and professional online persona that reflects them as model employees of the company.\u00a0Source: BluetreeAlways encourage engagement during the callRemember that communication goes both ways. A virtual sales call is not a one-way lecture, so it\u2019s important to engage with the customers and client during the call.\u00a0After all, prospects who engage with your sales team or brand are more likely to convert into a customer.During one-on-one calls, regularly ask the prospect questions about how they are enjoying the presentation, or prompt them for any questions or clarifications.\u00a0During group calls or webinars, it\u2019s a good idea to use online polls or have a moderator to manage questions and engagement from the audience.

            "content": "The notion of remote work has been around for a while now. Even before Covid-19 forced the employers\u2019 hand at making it a necessary means of carrying out regular office work, it has been widely used by many working individuals.Let\u2019s take a look at the Gallup poll where it was revealed that 43% of employed Americans log out-of-office time. 31% of these employees work remotely 3-5 days a week.47% of working millennials now say they freelance in some capacity.Now that the 2020 global epidemic has pressured employers around the world to opt for the remote working option, the popularity of remote work is soaring.Many companies are concerned about data security; many others are butting heads on the productivity factor. They are right at their standpoint, but there are many points that make remote work arrangements beneficial to everyone involved.Many employers have already allowed their traditional workforce to work remotely. As the battle of benefits and drawbacks continues, we are here to help you understand the why and how of making remote work productive for your organization.Table of ContentsWhat are the most significant benefits of a remote workforce?What are the challenges faced by remote workers?What are the essential tools remote workers can use to connect and collaborate?What are the tips for remote workers?What are the most significant benefits of a remote workforce?The Benefits of Working Remotely 2020 is originally published on Statista by Arne Holst.This statistic shows the most significant benefits of working remotely in 2020. As per this survey done with 3,500+ respondents, 32 percent of respondents cited the ability to have a flexible schedule as the biggest benefit of working remotely.Having a larger potential labor pool is the most significant benefit that employers derive from remote work. Imagine a talent pool that is not restricted due to geographic and political boundaries.\u00a0An employer in the USA found a better pool for his next project in India but cannot get them to the states, but with remote working, this becomes possible. Plus, with an open talent pool, the discovery of the right candidates rises tenfold! This is also beneficial to employers with an economic point of view.When you are hiring someone in another country, the salary structure can be less expensive than your in-office employees.\nAs per the survey conducted by Global Workplace Analytics, 53% of remote workers reported they were likely to work overtime.In another study conducted by Umea University, it was found that couples that have at least one partner commuting longer than 45 minutes per day experience 40% higher rates of divorce than those with shorter commutes.Remote work also keeps the employees online and healthy as it keeps them at low-risk of catching the virus while commuting.And with climate changes causing drought and wildfires, a remote workforce will help companies work online effectively.What are the challenges faced by remote workers?Remote work is not about those long binge hours, as many employers might dread what their employees might be doing on a workday! As the data mentioned above suggests, remote work brings out more productivity as it is more goal-oriented.A word of advice for managers and employers is to focus more on the deliverables and less time on how much time employees are actually spending on their tasks. Remember, they are not in the office anymore! They are at their homes, and now they are playing two roles!We won\u2019t be giving too much attention to the challenges employees face while working remotely as it is generally related to household chores and running market errands. But there are challenges!Have open communication, set clear expectationsSyncing themselves with the team! Yes, with social distancing and working with around 30% of staff, not many employees see their colleagues often these days. In such a scenario dissatisfaction will fester and synchronization regarding the expectation of results will also go for a toss.This makes over communication really an important factor for employees. When you have your daily meetings, clear out what is expected from each of your team members. Set strict deadlines, and schedule check-ins so that your team members have a sense of accountability.When your team members have the criteria at which their productivity is being judged and what you expect from them, they will give you the required results. It\u2019s also necessary to keep your team on the same page and keep them focused on your organizational goals.Foster a virtual company cultureIn this digital age, it is not impossible to get your employees on board for instilling a virtual company culture. Encourage your team members to engage in virtual conversations and have them interact online with each other.Organize little observances, such as birthdays or completion of a project, the achievement of sales figures. This way everyone in the organization will feel that their remote working efforts are get"

Acknowledge the crisis\u00a0Acceptance of reality is a must. The more you ignore it, the more you might suffer. It is important to respond to a crisis rather than reacting to it negatively. Do not freeze or panic.Be alert to make real-time decisions.Know the level of crisis intensity you are dealing with.Communicate with your seniors, stakeholder, and customers.\u00a02. Tweak your strategies and create a new action plan\u00a0It is time to level up your sales game. The current situation requires new sales strategies and action plans.

Showing empathy during a crisis towards your potential buyers is simply the right thing to maintain a healthy relationship with them.\u00a0Do not emphasize on your discount and offers; shift your focus towards the prospects.\u00a0Find out how your prospects are coping with the current crisis.Understand how their business is impacted and what problems are the prospects facing.Guide them on what they can do to address the problems and how your solution can help.\u00a04. Keep an eye on the competitors\u00a0Never lose sight of what your competitors are up to. Yes, the sales pressure is even higher during a crisis. However, you need to stay aware of everything that your business competitors are doing to attract prospects during the crisis.\u00a0Follow your competitors on social media sites and keep track of their activities.\u00a0Find the gap between you and your competitors.\u00a0Read their PR & articles and go through their websites to check if they\u2019ve added new features or services.5. Don\u2019t be discouraged\u00a0Sales has always been a challenging field. The difficulty level without a doubt increases during a crisis.\u00a0However, it helps you to become better as you try new ways to move a deal forward in the sales pipeline.\u00a0So, do not get disappointed if you receive negative responses from your prospects. There are even chances that your prospects might not reply at all. However, do not give up.Keep sending follow-up emails.\u00a0Try to connect with your prospect at different hours of the day.\u00a0Use different channels to connect with your prospects like text messages or social media sites.\u00a06.

Avoid giving discounts or making promises you cannot keep just to sell the product.\u00a0Focus on the value of your product.Be explicit about how the product will help the prospect in such a crisis.\u00a0Highlight the benefits the prospect is missing ou"

            "content": "Did you know that 51% of recipients delete emails within the first few seconds of opening it?Yes, you have a few seconds to impress your prospects.Besides, in the case of cold emails, the difficulty level is even higher as they are sent to potential prospects who have no prior relationship with you.Getting someone to open an ice-cold email is challenging.\u00a0Apart from you, there are many more sales reps from different companies vying to get your prospect\u2019s attention.\u00a0Your cold email needs to be impactful and stand out from the rest to get a click from the prospect.Well, that\u2019s not the end of the road. Each line of your cold email should be persuasive enough to hold the prospect\u2019s attention and persuade them to respond.So, how to create an effective cold email?Cold email isn\u2019t just about drafting an email introducing your product and sending it to a potential prospect.Cold outreach emails need proper planning and preparation. You need to pay more attention to how you draft a cold email and whom you are sending it.Everything from your subject line to your email body, as well as CTA, should be perfect.Cold email is, without a doubt, a challenging task, but if done right, it can acquaint you with many lucrative opportunities. So, give it your best.\u00a0\u00a0It always seems impossible until it is done. \u2013 Nelson MandelaHere are the questions you need to ask yourself for creating impactful cold emails.1. Do I have a proper list of prospects and have I done my research?Don\u2019t just take a list of ID(s) and start sending emails.As I said, \u201cPREPARE\u201d before you send your cold emails.\u00a0First, create a proper list of prospects with their email ID(s).\u00a0Go research about them on LinkedIn to find out their role in the company. Make sure you target the right person from the company.\u00a0Study their company website to understand what they do.If you are targeting different industries and businesses, then create a prospecting list with different segments.\u00a0Group people with similar business from a specific industry under one segment. If you want to make your work more comfortable, you can take the help of the best CRM that allows you to segment and add filters to your prospect lists. So, you won\u2019t face much trouble while sending cold emails. Besides, you can even track your emails inside a CRM to see how effective your outreach is.\u00a0Once you complete the list segmentation, study the market of businesses in each segment, and determine what problems they commonly face. This information will be beneficial while drafting your cold emails.\u00a02. Is my subject line enticing enough to get a click?\u00a0Put yourself in the prospect\u2019s shoes and think, would you open the email after reading the subject line you\u2019ve written.\u00a0If not, then delete it and put in more effort.Wear the creative hat and write a compelling subject line for your cold email that immediately grabs the prospect\u2019s attention.\u00a0Your subject line should-\nBe relevant and exciting.\u00a0Make the email recipients curious.\u00a0Give readers some idea of what they can expect in the email.\u00a0Have minimum words and yet be catchy.\u00a03. If I was in the prospect\u2019s place, would the first line motivate me to read further?\u00a0The first line decides the fate of your cold email, whether it will get a response or be deleted. So make sure you start it right.\u00a0Personalize your emails to capture the prospect\u2019s interest. Make sure your cold email focuses on the prospect.\u00a0The opening sentence of your cold email can be about something you read on the prospect\u2019s website, or you can highlight problems that most businesses like them usually face in their market. You can even start by congratulating them on some of the recent accomplishments.For instance;Hey Pearl,\u00a0Congratulations on being ranked in New York\u2019s top 50 Female Entrepreneurs list. It was indeed inspiring to read about your journey.This shows you\u2019ve done your research before sending the cold email. Adding such information helps in building trust and credibility.\u00a04. Is my email too long, and does it propose the value?\u00a0Nobody is interested in reading lengthy and boring emails. So ensure your cold emails are short, simple, and precise. Avoid extra information and long stories about your company and product. So, once you have a great opening line, get to the point.\u00a0Please give them an apparent reason why you are writing this email. Talk about what you can do to help them and make their life easier. State the benefits of starting a business relationship with you.For instance, \u201cI did a fair amount of research and went through some of the reviews of your clients that said [the problem area] I can show how by [solution] you can [benefits]\u201d\u00a0\u00a0You can even speak about how you can help the prospect reach the same level as their competitors (well for this you need to study about their competitors and how are they better)For instance,\u00a0\u201cX and Y competitors are [point out things they are achieving, and the prospect isn\u2019t] I can show you how you can achieve the same with [your product]\u201c5.

Whether it is Apple, Nike, or BMW, everybody uses this impactful technique to offer a great buying experience.\u00a0Before we delve deeper into what is personal selling, let us look at a fictional situation.You lost your phone, and so you need a new one. You don\u2019t have time for research as you need it on an urgent basis. You go to a mobile store and get confused, looking at the wide array of phones displayed there. Suddenly someone from the store having knowledge about all those cutting-edge gadgets approaches and asks you what you are looking for. He asks various questions to understand your requirements. After studying your needs, he shows you a few phones and you decide to purchase one of them. The conversation you had with him helped in getting what you were looking for.\u00a0Well, this is what we need to do in real-life as well and help our customers in getting what they exactly need. Have a one-to-one conversation to understand their requirements before offering a product. You need to establish and maintain a lasting relationship with your prospects.\u00a0Every single interaction, the most minute details of the interaction you have with you customer, are an opportunity for you to create something remarkable. \u2013 Joey Coleman\u00a0What is personal selling?\u00a0Personal selling is an approach where sellers humanize the sales process and try to help the prospects rather than just selling a product. So, instead of bragging about a product, they step back and listen to the prospects. Sellers try to identify the problems that the prospects are facing and show them a way to eliminate them.\u00a0Earlier personal selling was only confined to face-to-face interaction between the seller and the prospect. Even now a face-to-face meeting is important for personal selling. However, thanks to the technological advancements along with in-person meetings sellers are also leveraging calls, emails as well as video calls for personal selling.\u00a0Personal selling tips\u00a0Personal selling is one of the most effective sales techniques that help in building trust and persuading the prospect to buy the product.\u00a0Here are some tips for using this powerful technique effectively.\u00a01. Exceed expectations through preparation\u00a0Preparation is of paramount importance in personal selling. To establish a relationship and make the prospect comfortable, you need to do a little research before contacting them.\u00a0The will to succeed is important but what\u2019s more important is the will to prepare \u2013 Bobby KnightSo invest some time in planning and preparing. Take a look at your sales pipeline and make a list of high-value deals. Plan how and when you will approach each deal. For making your work easier, you can take the help of the best CRM where you can add activities and keep track of them. You also get a clear view of all your deals to prioritize them.Once you prioritize your deals, start researching about each prospect and gather as much information you can.Go through their social media profile and see what kind of accounts they are following.On LinkedIn, you can see what kind of posts your prospects are liking. This will help you in understanding their areas of interest.Go through their website and study them.\u00a0Find out who your prospect\u2019s competitors are and how they are better.Find out if there are any reviews written about your prospect\u2019s company. The negative reviews will help you in understanding your prospect\u2019s weak areas.\u00a0Gathering basic information about your prospect will help break the ice and personalize the initial conversation with the prospect. So, make sure you research about the prospect before initiating a call.\u00a02. Ask questions\u00a0Once you break the ice and establish a relationship, you need to focus on finding out the prospect\u2019s requirements, challenges, and goals.Make the most of the discovery call to understand your prospect.\u00a0Do not hesitate to ask questions. For personal selling, you need to know your prospects in and out.\u00a0Find out-What problems are they facing\u00a0What are the pressure points (The weak areas that might affect their business if they don\u2019t act immediately)What do they aim to achieve in the next few years?What\u2019s holding them back from achieving their goals.\u00a0Once you gather enough information, try to schedule a face to face or virtual meeting with your prospects to show them how your product can help them.\u00a03. Use emails effectively\u00a0After the initial contact, you will have to warm up the prospects and follow up with them to schedule a meeting. For that, you can use emails, but you need to be very careful while using it.\u00a0\u201cNo general messages\u201d Try to personalize your emails.\u00a0\u00a0For instance, you need to follow-up with a prospect who was supposed to call back and provide her convenient time to meet you. However, that didn\u2019t happen, and the prospect isn\u2019t answering your calls. So you think of following-up with an email.\u00a0Hey, Laurna,I h"

            "content": "We have all used to-do once in our work life.Some of us (me) are purely in love with the concept and use every single day to finish tasks one by one. There is definitely a sense of accomplishment when you cross off a task.But, did you ever think beyond to-do?I mean, to-dos give us a broader picture of our day. But they are not making any addition to our work style. It is merely reminding us of what our day looks like, and what to do next.What if there is a to-do that can help you complete your tasks one after another, and add value to your work style for real. A tool that can drastically improve your sales productivity.Welcome to the world of Smart Queues, my friend.What is a Smart Queue?In simple words, a Smart Queue is a series of tasks or activities that run one after another, taking away manual efforts from your everyday routine.\u00a0Smart Queue feeds you one activity after another in a row so a user can complete the maximum number of tasks in a time frame using task automation.The concept behind the Smart Queue task automationThe whole purpose behind designing Smart Queue is to steal the time that you otherwise waste in between two tasks. The motive is to eliminate the manual effort & time that sales reps make either to make a call, switch between activities, or change the status of activities.\u00a0Smart Queue takes away that part of the process from your routine, so you are left with more time naturally.\u00a0Think about it. Suppose you have a 4-step process, and it takes a day to complete. If you automate the 3rd step, it will naturally complete in less than a day.How Smart Queue can help your sales teamIn our experiments, we have found more than just time saving with Smart Queue task automation. These are some of the obvious benefits you\u2019ll notice after using a Smart Queue:1. More number of tasks per day: Because you have saved a lot of time with task automation.\u00a02. More focused on the activity: Because you have one activity after another coming up. There are no extra efforts given, no distractions, no changes in the to-do \u2013 A dedicated list of activities that you have decided and finished off like a pro.3. No thoughts on what to do next: It sounds stupid, but we all have been through this. Wasting a good number of minutes on what do I have to do next, even though we have our very own to-do. We often make sequential changes in our task list all the time. Smart Queue takes you from one task to another. Here, your complete focus is on executing activities.\u00a0\u00a04. More individual & overall productivity: Not just sales reps can perform more tasks per day, but they can execute their tasks with a faster approach.Apart from these 4 benefits, I have listed down some 2nd or 3rd level benefits that come as byproducts for sales reps and managers after using Smart Queues:For Sales RepsFor Sales ManagersA simplified work-environmentA faster and better-performing sales teamEasy segmentation and execution of activitiesHigher chances of sales closingExtracted time to invest in self-coachingIncrease in the total number of cold callsInvest more time on lead nurturingSetting up better benchmarks for team evaluationBuild personal relationships with prospectsAn overall increase in team productivityExecute more tasks per dayTime for team coaching activitiesEntertain hot leads on the right timeWhat are the things you can control in a Smart Queue?Even though automation is the heart of Smart Queues, users still have all the necessary controls.\u00a0If I want to use a Smart Queue or any automation for the matter, I would want it to enhance my productivity, but it should still be in my control.\u00a0Smart Queue has the same concept.\u00a0\u00a0You have everything in control, yet it can help you save a lot of time. Let\u2019s dig deeper into the controlling parts so that we can get a better idea.1. Selection of activitiesThis is a fundamental thing, yet very important. Smart Queue is not something that runs on random activities. You have to choose all the activities and create a queue. The activity selection can lead us to a revolutionary way of working (more on that later.)Take a look at the image of Salesmate Smart Queue below:2. Pause and resume Smart QueueAt any point in time, users have the controls to Pause and Resume the automated queue. Take a look at the image of Salesmate Smart Queue:The Pausing feature can be handy when you want to take a short break or attend a brief meeting with your colleagues. After the break, you can start where you left off.3. Skip and rescheduleWhen the Smart Queue is running, you might want to keep some activities for the last. You can easily skip a particular activity and jump to the next one. You can even jump to a specific activity. For example, jump to 8th activity from the list of 26.While skipping can be very useful, it still keeps the skipped activity in the queue. Smart Queue also allows you to reschedule a particular activity for a desired date and time.\u00a0\u00a04. Complete activities and automatically logOne of the finest featur"

            "content": "Your sales pipeline covers every stage of the customer acquisition process from leads to after-sales support to repeat business. While revenue is a good indicator of success, it only measures what\u2019s coming out of the pipeline \u2013 in other words, the result. It doesn\u2019t account for leads that have \u201cleaked\u201d out. To be successful in sales, you need to track specific sales pipeline metrics.\u00a0Tracking sales pipeline metrics becomes easier to do as your company grows, and the volume of leads you are managing increases. Any improvement in your conversion rate will lead to a direct increase in revenue. These increases can be substantial.The metrics below will help you measure your success in attracting attention, getting prospects to consider your brand, and making customers choose you over your competitors.\u00a0Let\u2019s get started.1. Sales Cycle LengthHow long does it take you to close a sale? For B2B businesses, the sales cycle can take anything from 1 to 12 months. The exact length depends mainly on the value of the products or services.Source: Mktg MentorsLooking at your sales cycle lengths, and their different variables can help you identify what makes individual salespeople more effective, or why certain products have a higher conversion rate.\u00a0Create a graph similar to the pie chart above, accounting for the length of your successful sales cycle for at least the last year. This data will show you the average length of your sales cycle. You can analyze this information alongside the type of products being sold and the salesperson handling each sale. Insights gained from this can help you maximize your sales cycle efficiency.\u00a02. Opportunity Win RateYour success rate for closing deals will depend on your target market, your niche, the products you sell, and the area you serve. Knowing your opportunity win rate and comparing it against your competition will help you identify areas for process improvement.You can calculate your opportunity win rate using the formula below:Win Rate = (Number of deals won / Total number of opportunities) X 100This number gives you a glimpse into your effectiveness in closing deals. It is also one of the factors that go into calculating your cost of sales. If you increase your win rate by 100% in one month, it means you were able to close twice the number of deals with the same number of sales reps, or through the same sales process.\u00a03. Ratio of Leads to Sales Qualified LeadsThe ratio of leads to sales qualified leads measures how efficiently your sales team is qualifying leads and starting to move them through the sales process. It is also a measure of the quality of the leads you generate.\u00a0If your ratio of leads to sales qualified leads is low, it might mean you\u2019re not attracting quality leads \u2013 that is, people likely to make a purchase. As a sales pipeline metric, your ratio of leads to sales qualified leads is useful for understanding the effectiveness of your targeting. It can also provide other insights.For example, if one of your sales reps has an unusually high lead qualification ratio, see what you can learn from them. Maybe they have an excellent understanding of the customer persona or your products and could teach their methods to others in the team.You might need to provide additional training for those who are facing challenges with lead qualification. Maybe they\u2019re targeting potential customers in the wrong industry or trying to sell in a territory that is a captive market for another brand.Knowing your leads to qualified sales leads ratio will help you identify what practices are working, which ones you should change, and how you can improve your customer targeting.4. Average Deal SizeYour average deal size is a useful sales pipeline metric for assessing gross revenue. Your average deal size can:Help you identify whether your products and services are priced appropriately.\u00a0Shows how much customers are willing to pay for your products.Identify what type of customer to targetThis metric is most useful among salespeople, especially when they\u2019re calculating their sales goals and progress towards them. For example, if a sales rep has a yearly goal of around $1,000,000, they can divide this total by the number of deals they expect to close and the average deal size. If they intend to close 200 deals for 2020, each sale should have an average value of $5,000.\u00a05. Deal ProfitabilityDeal profitability is an important sales pipeline metric. After all, it\u2019s essential to understand how much of the gross revenue from a contract actually ends up in the company bank account.\u00a0To measure deal profitability, first, calculate how much you will be spending to land the deal. This refers only to deal-specific costs, such as hourly staff costs, travel, documentation, or client entertainment. Deduct the total expenses incurred from the value of the deal. This figure tells you the profitability of a deal.Knowing your deals\u2019 profitability makes it easier to either justify spending on deal-related expense"

            "title": "7 stages of sales pipeline every entrepreneur should understand",
            "content": "Successful entrepreneurs understand the importance of generating a continuous stream of leads and turning those leads into customers. This is how your business grows. The amount of time it takes to turn a lead into a customer will depend on the service you are offering, and the price of that service.Sales professionals generally visualize customer acquisition through the stages of a sales pipeline. Sales strategies can be applied at each stage of that process to help turn a qualified lead into money *ahem* a customer.Understanding how your sales pipeline is working is vital if you want to optimize your revenue generation. A robust sales pipeline will give you valuable insight into anticipated revenue, cash flow, process bottlenecks, resource gaps, and overallocation. In this article, we\u2019ll look at seven stages of a sales pipeline every entrepreneur should understand.1. ProspectingProspecting is the first stage of a sales pipeline. During the prospecting stage, you collect leads and record their contact information. You might generate these leads through activities such as email marketing, social media campaigns, PPC campaigns, in-person events, content marketing, cold outreach, or other approaches.There are some obvious levers for growth in this stage of the sales pipeline. They are:Basic Targeting: understanding who you are targeting and where you can find leadsSales Channels: determining which is the most effective sales channel to acquire leadsConversion Rate Optimization: improving the messaging you use and your approach to push more potential leads into your sales pipelineThere are too many variables at play for me to provide you with much useful information about those first two points. Fundamentally, you will need to research the customer journey, create a customer persona, and track leads down your funnel by sales channel.In the digital marketing space, the simplest way to generate warm ready to buy leads is to offer a free consultation. You can use a landing page builder to create a suitable landing page.It\u2019s simple but effective.You can take this approach to the next level by setting up retargeting ads across FB, Google Ads, or Youtube, that pushes these prospects to a landing page where you offer a content upgrade. This will help you increase your lead acquisition volume by targeting people who might be interested in making a purchase but aren\u2019t ready now.Below is a basic overview of an effective funnel for the prospecting stage.If you\u2019re serious about applying this approach, I recommend you buy the book Sell Like Crazy, by Sabri Suby. It\u2019s an easy read and covers the theory in a lot of depth.Once you have your leads, it\u2019s essential to manage them efficiently. You can do this manually, but that is time-consuming and puts you at risk of missing an opportunity due to human error. Therefore, I recommend you use an automated tool for your CRM.2. Lead QualificationDuring the lead qualification stage of the sales pipeline, you develop a relationship with your leads and segment your leads according to quality. You can partly automate this process with an email drip campaign.A drip campaign is a triggered sequence of automated emails aimed at achieving a specific result. A simplified email drip sequence would look something like this:Introduce who you are and what you offerExplain how your product or service can benefit the leadGive a case study that proves the quality of your product or servicePitch for a consultationWith email marketing, the two main levers to prompt action are logic and emotion.If you\u2019ve never set up an email sequence before, set aside a bit of time to research Frank Kern and Ryan Deiss. Both marketers made their millions through email marketing.A nice example of an effective out of the box email sequence for sales is Gain, Logic, Fear.Most of the time, the email drip campaign alone is not enough to move a lead down the pipeline. Therefore, it\u2019s essential to combine email marketing with other sales channels to nurture the relationship. Events and webinars are the best way to nurture your relationships at scale.Source: Business2CommunityIf you\u2019re going to use webinars during the sales pipeline, set $5 and a weekend aside to read Expert Secrets by Russell Brunson. The book is a masterclass on how to run sales webinars.3. Meeting ProspectsMeeting prospects is an important step on the path to a conversion. Precisely what this stage looks like will vary depending on your company and the prospect\u2019s preferences. Some people like to meet face-to-face. For others, a phone or video-call is better. Webchat, perhaps with a live demo of your product, are other options.\u00a0Whichever method you choose, this is the stage where you\u2019ll explain your product or service in detail, and highlight the benefits of purchasing it. If your prospect has sales objections or questions, this is where you get to address those.\u00a0If your prospect seems receptive and ready to seriously consider a purchase, this is also the "

            "title": "How sales motivation can help you drive better results",
            "content": "Sales team motivation is a necessity in today\u2019s stressful and challenging sales environment. Most of the sales reps are losing enthusiasm and feeling stuck in a rut. This lack of interest reflects in their sales performance. They fail to meet monthly targets.\u00a0To reach targets, the sales team needs to put in the effort. However, not all the effort should come from them; even the team managers need to do their best. A little motivation from the managers can change the scenario and help drive better sales results.\u00a0Motivation in sales can make all the difference\u00a0If a car engine is not oiled regularly, it won\u2019t be able to deliver the expected performance. The same applies to your sales team; they are like the engine that requires regular oiling (motivation) to perform exceptionally well.\u00a0Motivating employees to work at their full potential is the main premise of successful management \u2013 Eraldo BanavocSo, motivate and empower your sales team. Here is how you can do it\u00a01. Public display of appreciations\u00a0Humans need appreciation to fuel their confidence and self-esteem. Sales reps feel good when their hard work is noticed and appreciated. It encourages them to work harder.Don\u2019t forget a person\u2019s greatest emotional need is to feel appreciated \u2013 H. Jackson Brown\u00a0Create a culture of recognition. Give compliments and appreciate even small wins.\u00a0Praise an individual in front of the whole team for his/her outstanding performance. Do not just send an email or a message. You can have an appreciation day in a month for recognizing the person who has performed exceptionally well in the current month.\u00a0Such appreciations work as a morale booster. Not only for the individual you praised but also for others in the team. Even others in the team would want such applause, and praises and so even they would put in more effort and work harder.\u00a02. Build transparency within your teamThe single most important ingredient in the recipe for success is transparency because transparency builds trust. \u2013 Denise MorrisonMost of the time, teammates steal each other\u2019s deals to reach their targets.For instance, a sales rep approaches a prospect and invests time in nurturing the deal. However, after a few contacts when the specific person is busy with something important or not present, the other rep connects with the prospect and tries to close the deal.\u00a0It is disheartening when you work hard on a deal, and someone else takes the credit. Such behavior not only creates conflict but also demotivates a sales rep. This happens when there is a lack of transparency.\u00a0So, try to build a positive environment of transparency within your team. It is difficult to bring synergy within the team in closed work culture.\u00a0All hands need to be on the same deck to steer the team in the right direction. Everybody in the team should know which companies are being approached. Which deals are handled by each member of the team. Break the wall within your team by bringing your sales reps on a single platform. Take the help of the best CRM software that provides a 360-degree view of each deal. With a centralized database, all the members of the team will have easy access to crucial information.\u00a03. Spot issues and encourage sales rep to overcome themConsistent poor performance demotivates a sales rep. They feel stuck in the maze of failure and cannot find a way out. As the head of the team, you need to analyze each sales rep\u2019s performance to spot the performance gaps.\u00a0Show your sales reps where they are headed. Encourage them to overcome the hurdles that are obstructing their path to success.\u00a0Challenge your sales reps. Set a deadline to overcome the issues. With the help of sales reports, track their performance. Reward the sales rep if they manage to overcome the issue and improve their performance.\u00a04. Ownership and accountability\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s easier to stand on the sidelines, criticize, and say why you shouldn\u2019t do something. The sidelines are crowded. Get in the game.\u201d Robert Kiyosaki, Author of Rich Dad Poor DadWhen you set goals for the sales reps, they might feel it is unrealistic or unreachable. So give the flexibility to your sales team to set their own goals and create plans to reach them.\u00a0When sales reps set their own goals, they are more likely to go after them. However, make sure you monitor their performance to see if they are meeting their own goals. If not, then have a one-to-one meeting and find out where they are facing problems. Clear their way so they can quickly reach their goals.\u00a05. Build good rapport with sales reps\u00a0Blur the line between a boss and the employee. Some sales reps fear the manager. They aren\u2019t able to communicate freely about the challenges they are facing while closing the deals. The pressure keeps building where they aren\u2019t able to close the deals.\u00a0So try to have a good rapport with your sales reps. Make them comfortable so that they can easily communicate with you and share their problems. Conduct fun activities or go out on a team lunch once "

            "title": "3 ways to effectively manage a remote sales team",
            "content": "Did you know that a sales team can be 13% more productive\u00a0when they work remotely?However, there are many moving parts to a sales process, and leading a remote sales team isn\u2019t a stroll in the park. Besides following the basic principles of sales management, you also need to set up your team and adopt a management strategy that addresses the unique challenges of remote working.Here\u2019s how you can effectively manage a remote sales team:1. Set clear expectationsWhen managers set clear priorities for their teams, 38% of employees feel more engaged and driven to improve their work performance. This is particularly important for remote workers who aren\u2019t getting constant supervision.Setting clear expectations, such as performance metrics and sales objectives, will encourage your team to manage their work autonomously. This allows them to feel empowered and motivated to reach the organization\u2019s goals.\u00a0Translate these expectations into clear online procedures (e.g., how to find leads, how to do cold-calling, how to take email follow up, how to close the deal) to support the execution of your sales strategies. Also, standardize processes and streamline workflows to minimize misunderstanding and inefficiencies that could lead to errors and delays.\u00a0In addition, team members need to know what to do when they encounter problems if they can\u2019t reach their supervisors right away. When clear expectations are communicated, employees are more likely to take initiatives and come up with solutions that are in alignment with the company\u2019s objectives.\u00a0You should also provide ongoing support and keep an open line of communication to make sure that team members are on track to meeting the expectations. While team members are working remotely it\u2019s easy for issues to arise that affect performance. Hop on a video call to discuss potential issues ranging from sales numbers being down to how their health may be affecting performance.\u00a0Frequent review of detailed reports with individual team members is also key to making sure that they\u2019re on track to achieving the objectives. Doing so allows you to troubleshoot and course-correct while ensuring that employees are aware of their performance and results.2. Invest in the right tools and resourcesYou need to provide your team with the right online sales tools and remote software so they can communicate with prospects and collaborate with their colleagues cost-effectively.SaaS sales tools allow your team to log in from anywhere with an internet connection and access the latest information in real-time. Team members can update prospect records from any device so everyone in the team can stay up-to-date.You should also have the latest versions of all documents and templates stored in the cloud, which employees can access at any time. This helps standardize processes and ensure that nothing falls through the cracks.Since team members will be accessing your system from anywhere and using a variety of devices, it\u2019s important to take the necessary steps to ensure cybersecurity and protect business-critical data.\u00a0As more people are using their own mobile devices for work-related activities, you should implement a BYOD (bring your own device) policy and provide sufficient IT support to ensure that team members are configuring their devices correctly.\u00a0In addition, everyone should be accessing the internal network via a VPN connection, which encrypts the data before it\u2019s transmitted across the internet to protect sensitive information from hackers.3. Build trust and encourage teamworkA successful sales process requires team members to work together and trust is key to effective collaboration. Yet, many sales teams structure goals around individual accomplishments, which discourage employees from supporting each other and working toward a common goal.Building trust is even more challenging for managers of remote teams because there are fewer interactions among employees. Therefore, you need to facilitate teamwork by encouraging communication.Plan your team\u2019s working schedule so there\u2019s as much overlap in work hours as possible. Not only can team members communicate in real-time but you can also respond to issues or questions right away.Just like managing a team in person, micromanagement does more harm than good. After you have clearly communicated objectives and key milestones, give your team the autonomy and opportunity so they\u2019re empowered to achieve the goals. In fact, it\u2019s found that employees who have autonomy tend to work harder.Also, schedule weekly meetings to address major challenges and brainstorm complex sales strategies so team members don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re left on their own.Don\u2019t overlook less structured interactions, which can help build trust among team members and encourage them to learn from each other. For example, allow time for employees to share new sales techniques or share their experiences in the weekly meetings to keep the line of communication open.Last but not least, encoura"

            "content": "Customer experience is quickly becoming the highest priority for online businesses. In fact, it\u2019s well on the way to overtake price and product as the main brand differentiator.\u00a0Yes, people value the experience more than money. Here\u2019s why: they don\u2019t want to spend money with businesses that don\u2019t provide the experience they expect, let alone with those treating them badly.Recently, this concept has been shifting, and instead of just \u201cnot bad treatment,\u201d customers want \u201cexceptionally personalized treatment.\u201d\u00a0Many of them are quick to leave a business that doesn\u2019t provide that.\u00a0As for highly positive experiences, people remember and seek them the next time they need to buy something. What\u2019s more, 91% of customers are willing to provide referrals for the companies that lived up to or exceeded their expectations. Word of mouth can become your secret weapon.All in all, many factors contribute to providing that highly positive experience but knowing your customers is the most important.\u00a0This is where customer segmentation comes into play.\u00a0What is customer segmentation?Customer segmentation is the process of dividing your existing buyers into groups based on their needs, habits, preferences, and other shared qualities.\u00a0The segmentation benefits both customers and businesses.\u00a0On the one hand, it helps businesses improve their ability to provide personalized customer experiences. This also includes mapping a customer\u2019s journey to discover all touchpoints of their interaction with the business.\u00a0On the other hand, it facilitates the ability to find the most valuable buyers and market products and services more effectively to them.There are many types of segmentation that businesses rely on to keep their marketing relevant.\u00a0Types of customer segmentationKnowing the types is important to understand which segments are relevant to your business and how they can inform your marketing campaigns.\u00a0Type 1: Demographic SegmentationThis is one of the essential segmentation approaches that categorize a customer base by the following criteria:agegenderethnicityeducationincomemarital statuseducation\u00a0job positionfamily sizereligion.In many cases, businesses use only the demographic factors they perceive the most relevant.\u00a0For example, a business that sells computers should benefit from segmentation based on age, income, and family size. Factors like religion and education are less relevant in this case.Type 2: Behavioral SegmentationThis is the process of categorizing buyers based on their interactions with a business.\u00a0The goal is to understand how to address more needs and identify more opportunities to improve their customer experience.Some common behavioral segmentation examples include:purchasing behavior. Product/category pages visited, shopping cart content, purchases, how many times they visited a store before making a purchase, etc.timing and occasion. This group involves buyers who made purchases on special occasions like birthdays, weddings, and Christmasuser status. These are non-users, prospects, first-time customers, regular buyers, and defectors (those who switched to a competitor).Type 3: Customer Journey SegmentationIn addition to learning about customer interests and needs, businesses also need to know which stage of the buying process they\u2019re in. To achieve this goal, the need to create a customer journey map.\u00a0That\u2019s where customer journey-based segmentation comes into play.\u00a0Here are examples of segments:those who bought from the business two months ago but haven\u2019t sincethose who abandon their shopping carts and never completed the purchasethose who buy only discounted and products on salesrepeat visitors who haven\u2019t bought anything but have a product in the shopping cart.This approach helps with targeting customers with more useful and relevant marketing, offers, and recommendations. Understanding customer actions is an essential element of business development.Type 4: Geographic SegmentationAs the name suggests, this process is about categorizing customers based on their location. The location provides many valuable insights for businesses because it helps to define expectations, local traditions, and usage patterns.\u00a0Here are the common geographic segmentation variables that businesses use:region. Some regions have shared cultural and other preferences\u00a0country. Countries have unique holidays, customs, and issues\u00a0climate. It may affect marketing and products sold in a specific area during a specific time periodcultural preferences. International businesses need to respect these differences to incorporate local traditions.Geographic segmentation is often used in combination with other types.\u00a0Here\u2019s a recap of all of them:Source: Tidio Live ChatBenefits of Customer SegmentationThe one-size-fits-it-all approach rarely works.

However, their determination and passion towards helping the customers made them acclaimed personalities in their respective domains.\u00a0You might have an excellent idea or product, but it is incomplete without the passion and determination to sell it.Steve Jobs and Travis Kalanick weren\u2019t only fearless in making the first move towards entrepreneurship, but they were even zealous in achieving success.They understood their customers and tried to offer what they needed, which is why Apple and Uber became the preferred names in the industry.You\u2019ve sown the seed of startup, now to see it bloom successfully you need to learn the art of selling.Success is the sum of small efforts \u2013 repeated day in and day out \u2013 Robert Collier\u00a0Learning the art of selling\u00a090% of startups fail.Woah! That\u2019s scary, isn\u2019t it?But that\u2019s the truth that shouldn\u2019t be avoided.However, look at the bright side; there are 10% who succeed.Most people will worry about the 90% who fail, but there are some who would do anything to be amongst the 10 % of startups who succeed.They\u2019ll spend sleepless nights, learning, exploring, and experimenting to embrace growth.This level of passion and unwavering determination is required for reaching success.The best businesses are really ones that can combine passion, profits, and purposeSuccessful selling is an art that every startup owner needs to learn. As you\u2019ve just started, you might not have enough budget to hire a proficient sales team.However, you might be able to hire one or two sales reps. So, you need to get on the field yourself to get your first few customers.Make sure you note down the tactics and skills that work, it will help guide and train the sales team you hire in the future.Getting the first few customers is undoubtedly a challenging job as a startup. However, you just need to take the right path by learning the art of selling, and things will fall in place.Here are a few lessons to learn the art of selling:1. Art of selling lesson one: Think like a customerPut yourself in the customer\u2019s shoes and think about what they would want. What would your customers like? What are they looking for in a specific product?You too have been a customer for some other business when you purchased an appliance or a shoe.\u00a0Don\u2019t you like it when the seller shows you exactly the thing you are looking for?\u00a0You need to have that level of understanding, for providing a good buying experience.\u00a0\u201cGet closer to your customer, so close that you tell them what they need well before they realize it themselves\u201d \u2013 Steve Jobs\u00a0Change your mindset and think from the customer\u2019s perspective.Here are some questions you can ask yourself:What problems would the prospect want to solve?What expectations does the prospect have from you?What benefits is the prospect looking for?What are the risks associated with the purchase?Find the answer to these questions. See what hassles might arise while offering a solution.\u00a0How can you reduce or eliminate it?Find out how you can exceed your customer expectations.In other words, in what different ways can you reinvent, refine, or renew the fundamental benefits of your product.2. Art of selling lesson two \u2013 Don\u2019t think too much while making cold calls\u00a0Most of the sales reps get anxious while making a cold call.They feel what if the prospect isn\u2019t in a good mood.What if they get irritated?What if they don\u2019t connect again?In fact, most of them doubt if cold calling is still effective.Oh! If Travis Kalanick had thought so much, Uber wouldn\u2019t have been so popular.Even he used this effective approach to find his first few customers.Quoting Travis Kalanick\u00a0\u201cI went to Google, typed in San Francisco chauffeur or San Francisco limousine, I just filled out an excel sheet, and I just started dialing for dollars, right? The first ten guys I called, three of them hung up before I got a few words out, a few of them would listen for like 45 seconds and then hung up, and three of them said \u2018I\u2019m interested, let\u2019s meet.\u2019 And if you\u2019re cold calling and three out of ten say \u2018let\u2019s meet\u2019, you\u2019ve got something.\u201dThrough cold calling, you connect with new opportunities.However, cold calling needs patience and perseverance. If done correctly, cold calling can help your startups in getting its first few customers.So, use the right approach and be confident while making cold calls.\u00a03. Art of selling lesson three \u2013 Have something compelling to evoke curiosity\u00a0Until and unless you\u2019ve discovered something unique, you will find many competitors selling the same thing that you do.\u00a0Prospects are tired listening to the same thing from multiple sellers who try approaching them through calls and emails.As a startup, you need to think outside the box and do something different to evoke interest.\u00a0Give your prospects a compelling reason to"

            "title": "Negative reverse selling: An effective strategy for more wins",
            "content": "We are used to the things that happen in the usual way like the sun sets in the east and rises in the west. Stars appear during the night. We experience rains during the monsoon season.\u00a0We are prepared to react to things that happen to us often. However, a sudden change can make us think.\u00a0For instance, instead of snowfall, it suddenly starts raining in December. Or maybe one morning, the guard of your office says, \u201cHey dude, what\u2019s up\u201d instead of saying, \u201cGood morning Sir.\u201d\u00a0That\u2019s not normal, right?Prospects are also prepared to face the sellers who approach them to purchase a product. They know what to say or how to avoid the sellers.But if you take a different route and say something contradictory to what the prospect is expecting, then that might make them ponder over the situation.\u00a0What I am suggesting here is to use the negative reverse selling technique.\u00a0Not quite aware of it?Well, fright not, this blog will help you understand and use this effective technique successfully.\u00a0In this blog you\u2019ll get to read about:\nWhat is negative reverse selling?\nHow was the term coined?\nWhy is negative reverse selling effectively\nNegative reverse selling examplesWhat is negative reverse selling?Negative reverse selling is nothing but reverse psychology.Well, reverse psychology is a smart way of persuading someone, where you convince a person by doing the opposite of what they expect.\u00a0For instance, you force a kid to eat, and they will play all sorts of tantrums to avoid eating. Obviously, they are getting a lot of attention; they ought to take some advantage of it. When instead of forcing, you ignore and make the kids starve, they value the food.\u00a0Negative reverse selling is just applying reverse psychology to sales.\u00a0The parent in the above example is the seller, and the kid is the prospect. The seller (parent) is offering a solution(food) to the prospect\u2019s problem (hunger).\u00a0\u00a0The prospect (child) doesn\u2019t pay much attention when the seller(parent) forces too much. Instead of asking when the seller (parent) behaves differently, the prospect gets startled and starts showing interest in the solution (food).So, ultimately in negative reverse selling, you steer the wheel of conversation in a different direction by making statements or asking questions that are against your intended goal.\u00a0Often the prospects are ready with a shield for a typical sales pitch. They are prepared to be chased by the seller. However, instead of persuading, the seller makes unexpected statements or agrees by asking the prospect to elaborate more. This makes the prospect reconsider or explain the reason for their objection.\u00a0How was the term reverse selling coined?Reverse selling methodology is a term coined by David H. Sandler as part of the Sandler selling system. This methodology is used to make the prospect realize that they need the product rather than the sales rep \u201cselling\u201d it to them. It works as an effective strategy in difficult situations while selling.\u00a0\u00a0According to Sandler, selling is like fishing.While fishing, you need to be patient. You shouldn\u2019t hook right away when you feel the first nibble. Resist your urge and give the fish some line to run. Let it get serious about the bait and bite it; then, you can set the hook and reel it in.\u00a0The same is the case in sales. Where a prospect shows some signs, don\u2019t jump directly to the closure. Your enthusiasm in closing the deal might evoke suspicion and drive away the prospect. Instead, give the prospect some space to think about your product by doing the opposite of what you want.\u00a0Rather than just focusing on selling the product, negative reverse selling encourages you to push the prospect by driving the conversation in the opposite direction.\u00a0Using this technique, you can test a prospect\u2019s reaction to a specific aspect of your product. If the response is positive, you can delve deeper to explore the topic or move to something else.\u00a0Word of warning: Be careful while using this technique. If you don\u2019t use it in the right way, you may appear rude to the prospects.\u00a0Prospects aren\u2019t prepared for what you are going to say. A contrary statement or question should be framed appropriately. Use this sales technique diplomatically and selectively.Ensure you don\u2019t use it when you feel there are zero chances of the lead converting into sales. For that, you need to qualify and find out the hot leads to determine if there are chances of conversions.\u00a0Why is negative-reverse selling effective?\u00a0Think about this.You walk into a retail store and explore different dresses. As you are touching the fabric of a dress, a salesperson comes to you and tells you the dress would look good on you.\u00a0Would you get convinced and purchase the dress?Well, most of us repel from such pushy sellers.\u00a0Nobody wants to be sold to. Yes, a solution is needed, but the prospects are willing to discover it. A little help would be appreciated. But they wouldn\u2019t want someone coming and straight away selling a product.\u00a0The basic notion that "

With the rapid evolution of SaaS products, buyers\u2019 expectations are also increasing.Besides, new players are entering the market and doing all that it takes to prove their mettle.And how can we forget the old players who are innovating and improving the user experience to maintain their position in the industry?This makes SaaS sales more challenging, and the job of the SaaS sales rep difficult.However, the competitors are paving their way to the top, and surely their sales reps might have some contribution to their growth. So that just means that it is possible to succeed in this competitive field.All you need to do is take the right steps, explore various saas sales tips, and sell effectively.Success is the sum of small efforts \u2013 repeated day in and day out \u2013 Robert Collier\u00a08 effective SaaS sales tips to succeedSaaS is a complicated game. It would be best if you play it smartly.Here are a few SaaS sales tips that can help you in selling a SaaS product.1. Persistence is key to SaaS salesIn SaaS sales, you cannot afford to miss any opportunity that comes your way. If the prospect doesn\u2019t reply to an email or respond to a call, most of the SaaS sales reps give up without trying again.Persistence is crucial in sales. You cannot give up easily in this challenging SaaS sales field.You need to be like the spider who, despite falling several times, didn\u2019t give up. The spider\u2019s unwavering determination to weave the web helped him succeed.If you don\u2019t give up, you still have a chance. Giving up is the greatest failure. \u2013 Jack MaA similar determination is required in SaaS sales. You need to put in cent percent effort on a deal. Follow-up consistently when you do not get a reply.Besides, thanks to the automation that most of the technologies provide, it\u2019s easy to follow-up. The modern tools allow you to create email sequences for putting your follow-up on autopilot. This will help you in saving a lot of time for other sales activities.2. The length of the sales cycle can be shortenedThe long SaaS sales cycle is a scary sight for any sales rep. Nobody wants to miss their sales quotas, but unfortunately, many do.79% of sales reps miss their quota and 14% never achieve even 10% of quota.\u00a0The main problem is that the SaaS sales reps don\u2019t do anything about this failure.The SaaS sales cycle can be shortened if managed effectively. All the deals in the sales process should be given timely attention for a faster closure, which is why the top-performing sales reps use a SaaS CRM that offers a pipeline view of all the deals.A pipeline view adds more clarity and helps to see where the deals are in the sales cycle. So, you can prepare for the next activities and add them to your calendar.Besides, a SaaS CRM even reminds you about the upcoming activities through timely alerts and notifications, reducing the chances of missing any activity. This will help you in nurturing the deals quickly.3. Technology is a SaaS sales rep\u2019s best buddy\u00a0We live in a world where technology is evolving at a high pace, making human life more comfortable. You\u2019ll find many sales tools that act as an extra pair of hands for SaaS sales reps.Using these tools, you can get yourself organized, manage your sales, increase productivity, build strong customer relationships, and save a lot of time.So, analyze your SaaS business needs and then search for the best CRM tools for startups that can increase efficiency and add more time to the day.Here are a few of the sales tools that can help you.Salesmate CRM \u2013 An all in one sales solution with advanced capabilities that gives you more control over your deals and helps you in building long term customer relationships.Doodle \u2013 It is an advanced sales tool that simplifies the task of booking appointments so that you can spend more time on closing rather than organizing an appointment.Proposify \u2013 An easy to use tool that helps in creating professional looking proposals in minutes. Easily store important content, photos as well as logos and use it when you want.\u00a0DocuSign \u2013 One of the best e-signature tools that speed up the process of getting signatures. Prepare and send any kind of document inside DocuSign and get them signed quickly.4. Always be honestIn SaaS, it is important to focus on long-term success. It may seem enticing to stretch the truth or over-promise to close a deal, but that might fuel the churn rate.Recurring revenue is pivotal in SaaS; you cannot afford to lose customers here. In SaaS, it isn\u2019t only about hitting the quota, but it is about creating a base of satisfied customers who won\u2019t leave you.So do not make fake promises. Smartly present the truth.You might offer a few features but show them how can those few features help the prospect in reaching their desired goals.A lot can be done with a few things if you have the passion for it.

Power Dialer will wait for a specific number of seconds (of course, you will decide this) before making the call. The wait time allows you to skim through the details you want to discuss on the call.3. You can Pause the queue if you need more time before the call or want to take a short break.4. You can Reschedule the call in case the meeting is pushed. You can also Skip the call if that\u2019s not the best time for your prospect.5. Once you hit the Complete button after the call, it will automatically log activity as completed in your activity timeline.6.

I\u2019ll be honest; I was a little bit pissed when I had to dial one number after another.And that was just seven calls.When I started thinking about this whole scene, I realized that I have a very little patience span. Second, what happens to sales reps who have to do this every single day with much more intensity!Soon I came to know about this amazing feature called Power Dialer a.k.a Rapid Dialer that can take away this pain. Later, I got notified by my teammate that Salesmate is all set to present this feature to our customers.It feels like a circle getting completed.In this article, we will talk about what is power dialer, how it works, and how exactly it can help sales reps and drastically improve their efficiency.We will also take an example of recently released Salesmate Power Dialer, and understand how this feature can help your business.Let\u2019s do this!What is a Power Dialer?Power dialer, also known as call automation is an outbound dialer that automatically dials selected contacts one number after another without any manual efforts. You just have to choose the right contacts to call and it will automatically dial the contacts, taking away your manual pain.After every call, the sales rep can fill up the necessary information about the call or deal, and the power dialer dials another number.Often confused with predictive dialer, power dialer has a different concept.Call like you never did, Close like you never did!With Salesmate Power Dialer.Try Power Dialer Now!What is the difference between a power dialer and a predictive dialer?The difference between a power dialer and a predictive dialer is important to understand.A predictive dialer also dials a bunch of contacts but considering the availability of a sales rep. The algorithm calls multiple prospects at the same time and passes the answered call to sales reps according to their availability.Predictive dialing is a very older technique used by call centers for debt collection way back. In those days, predictive dialing used to be a hardware solution, it is available now as SaaS solutions as well.Power dialer, on the other hand, simply dials one contact after another where contacts are chosen by the sales reps.\u00a0So, we can safely say that predictive dialing is useful when there are a huge number of contacts to dial without any preferences. While power dialing can be extremely useful when you have a lot of calls to make with preferences.What are the benefits of choosing a power dialer?Now that we have understood the concept of power dialer, let\u2019s understand some of the major benefits of using one for your business.1. Drastic improvement in productivityThere is no doubt that power dialer can improve individual and overall performance.\u00a0It is obviously a way better approach than a rep dialing numbers manually. Calling with CRM is much easier than manual dialing as you have to simply click on the call button.But, the power dialer takes away that pain as well. All you have to do is choose the right contacts, and power dialer will take care of the dialing part.According to our experiments, Salesmate power dialer can 2X your overall performance when it comes to calling.2. Saves you a lot of timeWhen the dialing process is taken care of, you can clearly save time. Power dialer not only takes care of dialing, but it will take you to the relevant record screen where you can perform the necessary action, and move to the next call automatically!3. More calls, more closing, more revenueIn our trials, we have observed that a sales rep can do 35-45% more calls per day with a power dialer. That\u2019s a huge improvement in calling which will help you entertain deals on time, and eventually closing more deals.More sales closing will eventually help you generate more revenue for your business.4. Design your entire dayPower dialer can literally help you design your entire day. All you have to do is choose the right calling activities that you want to perform every day, and hit the start button.It\u2019s like a To-do with automation!Experience apex productivity with call automation \ud83d\udcdeTry Salesmate Power Dialer Now!Yes, I'm All In!How does Salesmate Power Dialer work?Salesmate Power Dialer is a part of a much bigger functionality called \u201cSmart Queue\u201d.\u00a0Smart Queue basically allows you to choose different types of activities (be it calls, demos, emails, anything) and run them one after another.\u00a0In this segment, we will be understanding one of the use cases of Smart Queue i.e. CRM Power Dialer.The first step is to choose all the calling activities that you want to perform in a day.

            "content": "Let\u2019s look at a hypothetical situation before we go ahead with the article.You want to purchase a washing machine immediately. You research and find the best brand. You call the nearest showroom to inquire if they have that specific model. They respond saying \u201cThank you for calling, we will check and let you know in a while.\u201dYou wait for a few hours. After several hours of waiting, you decide to call some other showroom in a different vicinity.Oh, the showroom where you called first, didn\u2019t forget you. They did call you. But after two days.By that time, you already booked a washing machine.Well, even your prospective buyers aren\u2019t ready to wait. Lead response time makes a huge difference in any business.If you don\u2019t give your potential prospect attention at the right time, they will approach another seller. There are plenty of options available in the market.If you don\u2019t take care of your customers, your competitors will \u2013 Bob Hooey\u00a0Why does lead response time matter?Lead response time is playing a crucial role in conversion.\u00a0Most of the leads generated through marketing campaigns are wasted.\u00a079% of marketing leads never convert into sales. \u2013 Salesmate\u00a0You cannot afford to take a lot of time in this competitive business world where everyone is looking to grab the opportunity they get. The longer you take to connect with a prospect, the less likely are you to convert the lead.Your chances of conversion dwindle with each passing minute. That proves lead response time matters a lot in sales. Your leads don\u2019t stay hot for long in the sales pipeline; they turn cold and slip through the crack.Statistics that prove lead response time matters in salesThe faster you act, the better results shall you get.Here are a few lead response time statistics that need your attention:\n50% of buyers select the vendor that responds first.You are\u00a021X more likely to qualify and convert a lead if you respond within 5 minutes.The chances of a conversion drop if you connect after 30 minutes.\u00a0Sales conversions are 391% higher when the leads are contacted within the same minute of requesting a demo.The above statistics speak volumes about the importance of lead response time.

So, when your sales reps call, text, or email the prospects, they can add it to that field.As per the stats that you read above, it is recommended to contact the prospects in the first five minutes.Many prospects display interest in a product by filling up the website form or requesting a demo etc. Sadly, they don\u2019t get the attention they expect.

Align sales and marketing\u00a0The lack of alignment between the sales and marketing teams ends up affecting the lead response time.While both play the blame game, the company suffers when the prospects take the exit door. Steps need to be taken to move these two important entities into a more productive relationship.The two need to coordinate to ensure the leads are approached and converted in real-time while meeting the sales quota. The sales and marketing teams need to engage in joint planning and work together to create value for the company.Break the wall and open lines of communication between two teams. Regular meetings need to be organized between sales and marketing to discuss opportunities in the pipeline.2. Embrace AutomationAutomation can help sales reps in reaching the prospects at the right time and improve the lead response time.Tasks like, assigning leads or sending prospecting emails, can be easily put on autopilot.The sales leaders have a lot on their plate, so they might forget to assign the leads to the sales representatives.

            "title": "How to retain your top sales performers?",
            "content": "Convincing someone to invest their hard-earned money seems challenging to many. However, there are a few top performers who excel at this art of persuasion.They enter the sales field like fearless warriors and conquer it using their impressive skills. However, these sales talents are thirsty for growth; they take a leap and switch whenever they get a chance to quench their thirst.A company that aims to grow can\u2019t afford to lose such gems. Besides, hiring and training a new sales rep is no easy job. So, it is important to take every measure for retaining these proficient sales talents.The average turnover cost per sales rep is $97,690But the question is \u2013 how to retain the top performers?\u00a0Nowadays, it is difficult to find a good sales rep. If you\u2019ve been lucky enough to find a few good ones, then take every necessary step to retain them.\u00a0Here are a few strategies for retaining top sales employees in your organization.\u00a01. Create a close-knit and transparent office culture\u00a0Internal conflicts are infuriating. Sometimes sales reps steal each other\u2019s deals and take the credits. The communication gap between different teams becomes the root cause of many problems. The blame-game adds fuel to the flame and makes things worse.Top performers have the skills, but they can\u2019t give their best in a negative environment. So, they try to move out of it. Don\u2019t let this happen; create a better work culture to retain your best sales employees.Break the wall between different teams and encourage them to collaborate and communicate with each other. Organize fun games occasionally to bring different teams together.Unity is strength. When there is teamwork and collaboration, wonderful things can be achieved. \u2013 Mattie Stepanek\u00a0Try to build a positive environment of transparency. You can take the help of the CRM software to boost collaborative productivity.\u00a0With CRM, sales reps can see which deals their team members are working on so that they don\u2019t approach the same prospect.Besides, most of the CRM offers a Shared Team Inbox feature. This helps in creating a shared email environment where team members can access all the email conversations. This will reduce the disputes within the team and help in adding clarity in the work process. So, the top performers can work peacefully and focus on reaching their sales quotas without worrying about anything.\u00a02. Give recognition and opportunities to grow\u00a0After spending a few years in a company, the top performers feel stuck at a single point. They can\u2019t see themselves growing.Besides, as they are good at closing, the management gets used to their victory and stops giving it much attention.No matter how far we go, appreciation is always motivating. So, appreciate the small wins of your top sales reps.If your top performers are consistently doing good and winning maximum deals, then give them the recognition they deserve. For instance, send emails about their excellent performance to everybody in the company.Their tremendous performance speaks volumes about their expertise and experience in a specific domain. So, instead of calling professional speakers from outside, you can give your top performers a chance to share their knowledge with others.Besides, they can play some role in strategizing also. Let your top performers do a little brainstorming to improve the sales game. They can even contribute to creating a sales playbook that will help in training the new sales reps.3. Invest in coaching and training\u00a0The best sales employees are ambitious. They are good, but they want to get better. Even the top sales reps face specific problems while handling high-value deals. So, they look for professional development opportunities. They expect continuous training to maintain high-quality performance.\u00a0So, give them regular training. See where they are facing issues. Get them registered for a sales seminar.Often sales organizations are confined to the tips passed down in the organization from the seniors. So, seminars will give the top performers an opportunity to learn from the industry experts. It gives them a chance to enhance their skills and learn new selling techniques.They can then come and present whatever they\u2019ve learned with other teammates. This will help in training the rest of the sales reps too.4. Have regular meetings to ensure everything is well\u00a0If your top sales performers are planning for a change, they won\u2019t tell you. They\u2019ll find a new opportunity, and then give you a sudden shock. So, you need to anticipate their plan to stop them at the right time.Conduct regular one-to-one meetings. Make your top sales talents comfortable so that they can freely share their real concerns.Find out \u2013\u00a0\nIf they still enjoy working in your teamIs anything bothering them?Are they demotivated due to something?Do they have anything in mind that they want you to implement?Do they require your guidance anywhere?\u00a0Do they have any feedback on suggestions?Are they stressed?Do they still feel motivated to come t"

            "content": "Well, you might have been taught by sales managers in your induction program that closing sales deals is an art and it is really simple. You have to be prepared, show up for your sales meetings, leave a mark on your prospects, navigate through their objections, pitch your proposal, and follow-up!Seems so simple right?When given a practical view, the selling process is a lot more complicated than this. And then you meet your managers for the weekly reporting, and they point out that you are losing your sales deals in the closing stage. They ask you why is this happening, where are you lacking, and why prospects are losing interest in the deal right before the closure.And you might say one of these things:\nI was waiting on the doc signature.I didn\u2019t do thorough research.I couldn\u2019t engage with the right people.I slipped a few follow-ups.Based on the industry you are in, you might have different issues or observations over losing the sales deals in the closing stage.Losing a deal at the closing stage is equivalent to losing an important revenue opportunity. It also means that all those time-consuming tasks, legwork done for meetings, and traveling have been thrown away.The science behind deal closure92% of the salespeople give up follow-up after four rejections. 80% of sales require 5 follow-up calls after the meeting \u2013 SalesmateSo, the majority of prospects provide an ample amount of follow-up time to the sales reps before deciding whether they want to decide a solution or not!Yet the statistics I have shared doesn\u2019t mean that every sales deal is four no away from turning into a successful deal.48% of sales calls end without an attempt to close the sale \u2013 SalesmateSo, let\u2019s throw some light on why you are losing deals in the closing stage!1. You lack a personalized selling strategyDeals are not a one-size-fits-all arrangement. If you are deviating from the en-masse strategy is especially significant in the present commercial market where purchasers can plummet in and out of the sales funnel at any phase in their purchasing journey.The advanced buyers are expecting a customized purchasing procedure that thinks more about their extraordinary difficulties and business needs.In that capacity, sales agents must know who they are conversing with, where the prospect is in the business cycle, how a buyer progresses through their journey, the context of their pain-points, and the client\u2019s expectations. Utilize this data for tailoring your content, value propositions, and sales strategy.\u00a0A sales enablement tool makes this procedure scalable, assisting in delivering customized deals experience modern buyers want.

You must\nfind out who has the final purchasing authority.understand their needs and pain points.\u00a0Even though there are numerous individuals in the buying process there will be some who are encountering similar pain points in the business process. Sales reps must use this data to their advantage, must direct their discussion in that way so that they can progress the deal through different stages of the pipeline.3. You failed to point out the correct problemSales reps always make the mistake of stretching the conversation too much and give lesser time to the prospects to express their issues.\u00a0The modern buyers are not looking forward to dealing with sales reps that are just going to treat them as a number in the excel sheet and overlook the challenges that they are facing.I would suggest that you keep your focus on helping these prospects rather than pushing them towards making a sale. Even if they convert, they will neither return to your business nor they will refer your product in their connection.So what must be done?Ask them questions and find out about their\u00a0\nneedschallengespain pointsIf you fail to get answers to these questions you will find it difficult to progress these deals through your sales pipeline.Always remember that as a sales rep your task is not just closing the deals, it is about making the most of the human connections. You are creating bonds that will bear fruit in the long run.4. You tried for the closure too earlyI hope you are not one of the sales reps who pitch their products on their first call itself. What I am trying to help you understand that you must never pitch your product to the customer without even knowing if they want it or not.\u00a0Yes, it is necessary that you try to close the deals as soon as possible but that doesn\u2019t mean you must be hasty abo"

Conclusion\nWhat is a sales pipeline?\nYou have often read terms like sales funnel and sales pipeline in articles that talk about generating or attracting hot leads. In this section, I will focus on what is a sales pipeline, and why it is important for you to keep it filled with new leads.\nSo, what is a sales pipeline?\nDefinition\nSales pipeline is a series of steps that enable your sales team members to organize and manage their deals and sales activities. The sales pipeline also provides crucial insight into your sales process to the sales team members.\nPurpose\nYour typical sales pipeline serves one common purpose; help sales rep navigate the leads via various stages and turn them into paying customers.\nApart from this, salespeople can easily visualize the stage of prospects inside their sales process. Doing so, your sales team members can easily understand the actions they must take for pushing the deals into the next stage.\nSales pipeline also allows you or the sales managers to check the deal stagnancy. They can take immediate actions and make sure that their sales reps do not get stuck on one deal while compromising the health of the entire sales pipeline.\nA healthy sales pipeline defines your entire sales process so that the sales reps can work within a streamlined system. Modern businesses use CRM for deriving valuable insights from their business data and making better decisions.\nA well-managed sales pipeline with precise information enables the sales reps to enhance the pace at which they close a deal. Closing a deal in the right amount of time allows businesses to generate enough revenue and keep the revenue cycle stable.\n\nHere is simplified math.\nYour prospect contacted you on social media or fill up their contact information on your website form. The CRM system created a contact for you, assigned the contact to an available sales rep, reminded the sales rep about the assignment, and sent a welcome email to the prospect. \nYour task is to make sure that the leads qualified by the reps after their initial communications spend less time inside your sales pipeline.\nTalking with the time in mind, if your sales reps are taking more than 4-5 weeks for closing a deal, then you will see a decrease in your bottom line.\n\nThen comes the sales funnel. In short, your sales funnel provides a visualization of the quantity and average conversion rate of prospects getting converted inside your sales pipeline.\nWhat are the sales pipeline stages?\nI am well aware of the fact that every company abides by its own unique process while building their sales pipeline.

            "content": "Do you know 60% of Buyers don\u2019t rely on B2B Sales Reps?\u00a0Why?Well, according to most of the buyers, some sales reps don\u2019t listen and others are self-centric as well as manipulative.\u00a0Woah! That\u2019s quite a negative impression. Isn\u2019t it?Well, think about your approach while selling over the phone. Do you call and try to discover your prospect\u2019s challenges and goals? Or straight away get to your product and waste your breath on bragging?\u00a0Yes, you have targets that need to be fulfilled by the end of the month. But even your prospects have business goals that they want to achieve.\u00a0Why would a stranger spend their few minutes listening to the functionalities of a product? S/he could rather use those precious few minutes in something more productive.\u00a0People are interested in their business, revenue, goals, growth, and problems. Why would they think about a product until and unless it solves their problem or has something great to offer?Try shifting your focus from your product to the prospect\u2019s problems. People look for solutions to their problems and opportunities to grow. If you manage to provide that, you might get into your prospects\u2019 good books and stick in their minds for long. Therefore, it is essential to focus on solution selling rather than just emphasizing the product\u2019s features.\u00a0\u201cYou have to understand customer needs before they understand your technologies\u201d \u2013 Steven Haines\u00a0But wait; what is solution selling?Solution selling is an effective sales methodology that has been in the sales world for quite a long time. This sales methodology emphasizes that sales reps should discover the customer\u2019s pain points and then provide a solution to address them.Solution sales approach was introduced in late 1970 by Michael Bosworth.Back then, most of the sellers used to follow the product-based sales approach, where they focused on showing their prospects everything their product could do. They spent their time going over feature lists and price options.Solution selling, on the contrary, had a radically different approach for making a sale. The sales reps who adopted this sales methodology focused on helping the prospects overcome the business hurdles by presenting their product as a solution.But does this few decades-old sales methodology fits in the modern sales environment?\u00a0Oh! It surely does.Due to the rising competition and pressure, most of the sales reps tend to overlook the buyers\u2019 needs. They are just focused on finding maximum buyers for \u201ctheir\u201d product to fulfill \u201ctheir\u201d monthly and quarterly targets.\u00a0Solution selling puts an end to the self-centered selling and directs the sales reps\u2019 attention towards the customers.Benefits of solution selling\u00a0Solution selling is one of the best sales methodologies for selling to smart buyers who have access to a plethora of information flowing on the internet.\u00a0The modern buyers are very cautious; they ponder over many factors before spending their precious money.They explore many options before coming to any conclusion. So, buyers would prefer a solution that would help then in getting out of the current problem that\u2019s obstructing their progress.\u00a0If you don\u2019t take care of your customer, your competitor will \u2013 Bob Hooey\u00a0That\u2019s why it is essential to steer the wheel of your sales towards solution selling for gaining the upper hand on the competitors.\u00a0Until you understand your customers \u2013 deeply and genuinely. You cannot truly serve them \u2013 Rasheed Ogunlaru\u00a0Below are the benefits of solution selling.\u00a01. You build deeper engagement\u00a0In solution-based selling, the limelight is on the prospect. You don\u2019t pitch the product and end it, but you develop a deeper engagement.There is an on-going conversation where the needs and suggestions are exchanged. Such engaging conversations help in building a good rapport with the prospects that play a vital role in influencing the buying decision.\u00a0How you sell matters. What your process is matters. But how your customers feel when they engage with your matters more. \u2013 Tiffani Bova\u00a02. You become a trusted advisor\u00a0Prospects rarely find sales reps who guide them. When you lead the prospects in the right direction, a trust is established. Prospects can comfortably share their concerns.You become a trusted advisor when you genuinely show interest in helping the prospect and provide a pleasant experience. A good image is created that motivates positive word of mouth.\u00a0\u201cBuilding a good customer experience doesn\u2019t happen by accident. It happens by design.\u201d \u2013 Clare Muscutt3. You double the chances of reaching your sales goalsSolution selling is the best way of creating a base of loyal customers. If you manage to earn your prospects\u2019 confidence, there are high chances they might purchase your product.They might even stay loyal to you if you deliver everything you\u2019ve promised during the sales process.

            "title": "Aligning project management and CRM: The secret to A+ business outcomes",
            "content": "For many of us, project management and CRM (Current Relationship Management) are two distinct processes that are largely different from each other. However, in reality, they aren\u2019t.\u00a0The range of activities carried out under both these management disciplines tends to achieve a common goal, that is, to satisfy customers and stakeholders alike.Most business leaders and even the individuals working in different project management and CRM roles fail to recognize the common ground between the two. As a result, the lack of coordination among the PMOs and CRM teams becomes obvious and it\u2019s the business\u2019s output that suffers the most damage.So, what organizations need to understand is that they need to align project management and CRM to make the business more profitable. By collaborating, it becomes possible for both project management and CRM departments to accomplish their objectives effectively.Now, let\u2019s quickly recall the roles of both project management and CRM in an organizationProject ManagementProject management focuses on utilizing various techniques that help you to organize and manage the resources available for completing a project. Additionally, project management also includes planning, distributing, executing, and controlling tasks associated with the project.As a project manager, you have the responsibility to lead and coordinate the team working on the project. The focal point of project management is to make the optimal use of resources and ensure timely completion of projects.CRMCRM or customer relationship management combines various ways with which you manage and improve the business\u2019s relationship with its potential and active customers. The ultimate purpose of CRM is to drive sales and thus, set the growth of the business in motion.A CRM manager\u2019s day-to-day activities include the development and refinement of channels used for interacting with customers, devise new customer relationship strategies, and identify ways to improve customer loyalty and retention.How PMOs and CRM Teams Can Align Themselves?For any business, the PM and CRM teams must work hand in hand to satisfy the needs and expectations of customers in the best possible way. Also, when customers are happy with the way their projects are handled, the business expands and the interest of stakeholders stays in favor of the business.Whether you are a project manager or a CRM manager you will need to take the initiative to bring your business\u2019s PM and CRM teams together.Here are some tips that will help you assure that your PM and CRM departments are on the same page:\u00a0Communicate team objectivesCommunication acts as the core of collaboration and when the aim is to establish and maintain a strategic alliance between two departments, nothing can be better than developing effective channels for interdepartmental communication.And what you need to make sure is that your project management department communicates its objective with the CRM department and vice-versa.This will make it possible for both the departments to plan their actions in a way that is beneficial for each other.Prioritize customer needsFor most businesses, it\u2019s imperative to keep the needs and demands of customers at the top of their priority list.While a CRM team convinces customers that your organization can handle their project efficiently, it\u2019s the project management office (PMO) that has the responsibility to meet all the expectations of customers.Both departments have to concentrate on the needs of customers and at the same time, address their issues and concerns with the ongoing projects.By prioritizing the customer needs, both PMO and CRM will automatically align with each other for improving the overall customer experience and satisfaction.\u00a0Use project management and CRM softwareTo create a meaningful synergy between both the departments, it would be great if the managers of both departments share their teams\u2019 real-time updates.For this to happen, all you need is to make use of leading sales CRM and project management software.With the help of such software, you will be able to view what is happening in the other team without the need to schedule any meetings.For instance, if you are a CRM manager, you can access your organization\u2019s agile project management tools to view each project\u2019s progress in real-time and communicate it with the clients.Benefits of aligning Project Management and CRMYou may now have got some clear-cut idea of the importance of uniting project management and CRM. So, now we would like to discuss some of the key benefits that your organization will get from this cross-department collaboration:Business objectives become visibleThe success of most businesses is largely dependent on the performance of their project management and CRM departments. When these two departments work closely with each other, it becomes easier for everyone on both the teams to stay focused on the business\u2019s goals and objectives.

            "content": "For sales reps, one of the most gratifying feelings is getting a prospect on a call after weeks (sometimes even months) of chasing.\u00a0However, if you\u2019ve worked in sales long enough, you know by now not to get too excited.\u00a0Statistics show that 80% of sales require 5 follow-up calls to close. The first time you interact with a buyer is really only the beginning of a much longer sales process. To get to the finish line, you must first master the art of follow-up.At Salesmate, we tried these tips and ended up booking 35% more sales follow-up calls!Tips for scheduling follow-up sales callsThe work you put in during the initial sales conversations with a buyer is crucial to building the foundation for a mutually-beneficial relationship, with the hopes of ultimately closing the deal further down the line.Getting a prospect to commit to a follow-up call can be just as difficult as catching them cold for the first time.\u00a0To add insult to injury, a lot can go wrong between sales conversations that could jeopardize your follow-up meeting. The buyer has time to consider your product, consider if it\u2019s worth pursuing, or even lose interest altogether.At the end of the day, you can\u2019t control whether or not they show up, but there are a few surefire steps you can take beforehand to increase the chances that they stick around.\u00a0Let\u2019s get started.Take detailed notes during the first callWhile it\u2019s true that a prospect should have your full attention during a call, you should still take notes to make sure you don\u2019t miss any important details.What you learn from the first conversation will shape your selling strategy moving forward, so it\u2019s crucial to jot down as much relevant information as possible.All the work that went into running the first discovery call can go out the window if you have no way of remembering what was said afterward.Many modern sales teams rely on conversation intelligence software to record calls automatically, but an old fashioned pencil and paper can still be just as useful if you\u2019re an efficient note-taker. All that matters is that your notes are detailed enough to guide you moving forward. \n\nTake notes while talking to your prospectsSalesmate empowers you to take notes while you're on call and add them to Contact timeline!Explore Built-in CallingGauge interestWalking away from a potential deal is never easy. However, it\u2019s sometimes necessary not to move forward with a prospect if you realize that your product or service does not fit their needs.By asking the right questions, you can gauge the prospect\u2019s interest and decide whether the next steps will even be necessary. If they show a clear disinterest in what you\u2019re selling, then it\u2019s OK not to schedule a follow-up call.Sometimes, it\u2019s just not a good fit. Although it might be hard to walk away from a potential sale, it\u2019s best to do so in the beginning stages of the sales cycle. You\u2019re saving yourself time in the long run by avoiding a deal that will likely fall through anyway.Outline clear and actionable next stepsAs a salesperson, it\u2019s your job to own the conversation and outline clear expectations for the next steps. During the initial call, lock down a date and time to re-connect while you still have everyone\u2019s attention.Ensure you get verbal confirmation that the agreed-upon day and time work well with their schedule. Tell them you will follow up with a calendar invite, so they know to expect a digital placeholder from you.Additionally, be sure to briefly let them know what you plan to cover during the follow-up conversation. If it\u2019s not apparent to them that another call is necessary, they may push back on your request. Be concise and explain exactly why another call is beneficial and what they will gain from agreeing to meet with you again.Send a follow-up email summarizing your conversationFollowing the end of the first sales call with a prospect, the immediate next step is to send them an email recap.This is where the notes we discussed earlier come in handy. The goal is to briefly summarize your conversation, highlight the main takeaways, and re-iterate any next steps you discussed.The keyword here is brief \u2013 no one wants to read a giant block of text in an email, especially right after a long sales call. Here\u2019s an example:Hi [name],Thanks for your time today. I enjoyed speaking with you and look forward to helping you kick off your lead generation efforts with [product name].To briefly recap what we talked about:Point #1Point #2Point #3As discussed, I\u2019ll send you a calendar invite for a secondary call on [insert date and time] to take a deeper dive into the platform and its features. Please let me know if you have any questions between now and then. I\u2019m happy to help.A follow-up email serves as a reminder of the meaningful conversation you already had and will give the prospective buyer an idea of what to expect on the next call.You can even create an email template where you fill in the details of the previous call.

            "title": "How often to follow up on sales leads?",
            "content": "You might have heard the adage, \u201cThe fortune is in the follow-up.\u201d This is definitely true in sales. For converting leads into sales, you need to follow-up consistently.\u00a0Prospects have a lot on their plate, so they might not remember your product. They are like those busy neighbors who are lost in their world. You need to knock on their door and remind them that you exist.\u00a0\u201cNot following up with your prospects is same as filling up your bathtub without first putting the stopper to drain\u201d \u2013 Michelle Moore\u00a0Do you know there is a 25% chance of hearing back from a prospect if you send more emails?\u00a0So, whether you want to get a confirmation for scheduling a meeting or need some information from the prospect, ensure you follow-up frequently.\u00a0A follow-up email is the most effective way to get a response and move the prospect forward in the sales pipeline.\u00a0But how often should you send sales follow-up emails? Well, let\u2019s find that out through this blog.\u00a0Before focusing on frequency, you need to give attention to two thingsFollow-up isn\u2019t just about sending a reminder email and nudging the prospect. There are two essential things you need to focus upon while sending follow-up emails.1. Ensure your Content is compellingAn average full-time worker receives 120 emails every day \u2013 TechJuryYour potential prospect\u2019s inbox is crowded. Your competitors might have occupied a space in your potential prospect\u2019s inbox. So, you need to break through the noise with a compelling follow-up email. Otherwise, there wouldn\u2019t be any point in sending multiple emails. You\u2019ll feel like your words are falling on deaf ears.So, wear a creative hat while drafting follow-up emails. Your subject line itself should be interesting enough to get a click.Your content should give the prospect a strong reason to reply. Put yourself in the prospect\u2019s shoes and think, would you leave your work and give your precious time to a follow-email with the same boring message.It is no fun to receive an endless chain of dull emails. Prospects delete such emails without a moment\u2019s hesitation.\u00a0Engaging content can help you in saving time. You might get a response on the second or third follow-up only. So, pay attention to the content of your sales follow-up emails.2. Make sure your timing is perfectBe strategic about your timing. Don\u2019t just draft a follow-up email and send it. Choose the right time and keep proper gaps between the follow-up emails. Don\u2019t just shoot continuous follow-up emails.\u00a0\u00a0Nobody likes interruption while they are working.\u00a0It takes around 23 minutes or more to refocus after an interruption \u2013 NexaLearningSo, ensure you don\u2019t disturb the prospect. Research and find out the ideal time to send sales follow-up emails to your prospects.\u00a0As per the data provided by CoSchedule, Tuesday is the best day and 10 am is the best time to send an email.Besides, ensure you plan your follow-up. Keep a few days gap after sending the first follow-up email and then send the second email.\u00a0But what if you forget to send the next follow-up email?\u00a0Well, there is a solution for that too. Most of the CRM software allows you to create sequences. So, you can easily set up the stages (the number of follow-up emails you want to send) to follow-up effectively.\u00a0Add the time and date of execution and relax; the CRM will do the rest for you. The follow-up emails will be sent in real-time automatically. However, you just need to ensure you\u2019ve set proper time intervals, or you might end up infuriating your prospects.Deciding the sales follow up frequency\u00a0Now comes the main question \u2018What should be the frequency of your sales follow-up emails?\u2019Well, it depends on the interaction you\u2019ve had before. If you are trying to establish a relationship with cold leads, then it shouldn\u2019t be more than three follow-up emails. In case of warm leads, you can extend the limit of follow-up emails.However, here are a few things you need to consider:1. Don\u2019t hesitate in sending more than two follow-up emailsMost of the sales reps send one or two follow-up emails and stop, thinking that the prospect might not be interested. Therefore, most of the leads aren\u2019t converted into sales.\u00a044% of sales reps give up after 1 follow-up \u2013 SalesmateLike you, even the prospects are busy trying to reach their business goals. So, there are chances they might miss your follow-up emails. Therefore, don\u2019t stop after two follow-ups, make another few attempts to capture the attention of your prospects.2. Don\u2019t irritate by sending more than six follow-up emails\u00a0Yes, you must not give up after two follow-ups, but you shouldn\u2019t even exasperate the prospect by sending 8 to 10 follow-up emails.Anything more than six is too much. It\u2019s good to be persistent. But be pleasantly persistent. Don\u2019t be pushy. There is a fine line between the two.\u00a0Your prospects might be occupied with some important tasks. So be patient. Few emails are enough to remind a prospect about a specific message. You don\u2019t need to spam them with too many follo"

            "content": "Overview \ud83d\udc47You\u2019ll hardly meet a sales rep who has never faced the \u201cprice objection\u201d.Almost all sales professionals have faced this objection in their sales careers.Some sales reps grumble while others tackle it wisely.Do you remember the times when you thought of not purchasing a product due to its high price? But then suddenly some words from a sales rep worked like a magic spell and made you change your decision.Oh yes, words have great power. It\u2019s all about how you persuade your potential prospects.Price objection is like a poison that can kill your sales. However, even the deadliest poison has an antidote. You just need to find it.Examples to handle the price objection in sales?\u00a0\u201cSorry, the price is too high\u201d.It is exasperating to hear this after all that hard work. Isn\u2019t it?After spending several days on a deal, you can\u2019t afford to lose it due to the \u201cprice objection\u201d.\u00a0So, stay confident and try to overcome the price objection.\u201cOffering a discount\u201d is the first thing that comes to mind when you think about tackling the price objection. That might seem like the easiest and quickest way of closing a deal, but it has a huge impact on the profit margins.So just discard that thought. Find a different approach to handle the price objection.Well, I\u2019ll help you.Here are a few tips with examples for handling the \u201cprice is too high\u201d objection.1. Answer back with a smart questionEnsure you take a brief pause whenever someone raises a price objection. Don\u2019t be in a hurry to answer; as what you say next can make or break a deal.Instead of giving up, ask some questions to your prospects and move them to a different track for thinking beyond the price.Handling price objection example:Prospect: Your product is too expensive.Sales rep: I appreciate your honesty. But setting the price aside, do we have the product you would want to purchase?[If Yes]Sales rep: Which features did you like the most?Prospect: [States the features]Sales rep: Using these features, you can [state the benefits]. Set aside the price for some time and mull over this solution that would help you in saving your time and efforts.[If the prospect responds with a \u201cNo\u201d to the initial question \u201cdo we have the product you would want to purchase?\u201d]Sales rep: What are you looking for in a solution?Prospect: [shares their needs][If you have the features that the prospect is looking for, then link it to their needs and explain to them how it can help. If not, then thank them for their time and focus on another deal.]With the help of questions, you can make the prospect ponder over your offering. So do not give up when you come across a price objection. Try once more before abandoning the deal. You never know things might work in your favor.2. Agree to the prospect but hit on the pressure pointsThe prospects might be facing some issues where your solution can help. So, it is essential to find out the prospect challenges and goals during the initial stages of the sales process.\u00a0If you\u2019ve gathered enough information during the discovery calls, then you won\u2019t face much problem in tackling the customer objections.People tend to react quickly when they are under pressure.Think about this hypothetical situation.You got a job offer from a renowned company in a different country and you need to migrate. So, finding a house in a new country as soon as possible would build pressure on you. You wouldn\u2019t spend time exploring options there; you might settle for something that serves the primary purpose.Similarly, you know what the prospect needs the most at present. So, just remind the prospect about the problem they have and make them visualize the consequence of not addressing the problem immediately.\u00a0Handling price objection example:Prospect: The price is too highSales rep: Yes, I absolutely agree this is a big investment. But as you mentioned earlier that you are facing [problem] that\u2019s impacting your business.Besides, I even read a few of your customer reviews on [reviewing site name]. They were unhappy about [the issues].If you don\u2019t resolve the problem, you might see an increase in the customer churn rate as well as face difficulty in reaching this year\u2019s revenue goal. A little investment can save you from losing your valuable customers. So, do you want to give it a second thought?3. Share case studies of a satisfied customer\u00a0You\u2019ve worked hard in creating a database of happy customers, so use that to your advantage. Create case studies and share them with your potential prospects. You can even share experiences of those customers who had price objections earlier but are happy using your product now.\u00a0Handling price objection example:Prospect: Sorry I wouldn\u2019t be interested; the price is a bit steep.Sales rep: Our product might seem expensive to you at present, but it is an investment that would bring you the best returns in the future.One of our customers had the same concern when I revealed the price of our product to him. But now you can read his positive statemen"

Customer retention is more budget-friendly than investing your time and money in finding new customers.For business owners, clicks and conversions will always increase their costs.When businesses start out, they do not have much to start off.They make marketing strategies; they pool their resources for converting potential clients into paying customers from their target customer base.Once they attain optimum customer conversions, they move on to hunt for new customers. They make fewer or no attempts to re-engage their old customers.Research done by the Harvard Business School proves that improving customer retention by 5% increases profit by 25-95%. \u2013 Harvard Business SchoolFor any business to survive and manage a healthy profit margin, retaining older customers is really crucial.And to do that, it is really important that businesses must re-engage their old customers.Before we proceed further, we would like to dig deeper into customer retention.\u00a0What is customer retention?A good retention strategy helps maximize the profitability of customers and businesses.Customer retention involves activities businesses carry out to increase their repeat customers. Such activities are targeted for increasing the profitability of businesses and customers alike.Successful customer retention strategies help business owners provide more value to their existing customer base.Small businesses know they have worked really hard to acquire the current customer base.This means they must work harder than their acquisition efforts to re-engage and retain their customers. Businesses can do so by maintaining the value their products provide to customers with other add-ons.\u00a0Customer acquisition is the foundation for businesses; customer retention is the key to remaining in the business and keeping the inflow of cash constant.Retention strategies take up time and resources; the trick is to distribute the customer retention effort.How can businesses do that? Well, the answer resides inside the CRM software that manages the contacts, their purchase and product interaction history, and their conversations with the business. \n\nExperience why 5000+ businesses love Salesmate!Take a 15-day FREE trail and try every value-driven feature from Salesmate CRM.Start your free trialLet\u2019s dig a bit deeper into customer retention before sharing the tips businesses need to re-engage their old customers.\u00a0Customer retention metrics for businessesBusinesses can work, rework, and enhance their retention strategies by simply understanding the key customer retention metrics.\u00a0What are these metrics? How do you measure them? More importantly, how do you improve them?If you have these questions after reading the opening line, then you are at the right place and time.Once we help you get the answers to these questions, it will allow you to equip yourself with the best customer retention strategy to enhance your business\u2019s profitability.Let\u2019s have a look at these three important retention metrics and tell you why they matter.1. Repeat customer rateThe repeat customer rate is considered a retention marketing backbone. This metric will allow businesses to measure the percentage of customers willing to make a second purchase.If businesses are keenly measuring their repeat purchase rate, it is easier to evaluate how well their retention strategy works.\u00a0The higher the repeat customer rate is, the more customers are willing to make a second purchase.CalculationThe number of customers with more than one purchase / The number of unique customers2. Purchase frequencyRepeat customers are responsible for 40% of the average store\u2019s annual revenue. This metric helps business owners see how often customers return to make another purchase.CalculationThe number of orders placed / The number of unique customers3. Average order valueOnce business owners have the data from the above two metrics, they can calculate how much value each purchase brought in for the business. This metric refers to the amount of money an individual customer is spending on each transaction.CalculationThe total revenue earned / the number of orders placedWhen should a business focus on customer retention?Whether you should focus more on acquisition or retention is heavily influenced by where your store is in its lifecycle. A store that started yesterday is vastly different than the one that\u2019s been up and running for many years.1. StartupThis stage witnesses the inception of a business that emerges after ideation, mixed with the business model and process.When business owners start out, there is only one goal in their mind; getting paying customers on board.This stage is critical as the acquisition is really important for generating the initial break-even revenue for the survival of a business.This is when businesses must only focus their efforts and strategies on growing a loyal customer base.2.

But it\u2019s easier said than done, isn\u2019t it?If you are a SaaS startup, you will be hungry for more signups and subscribers, if you are a digital product development startup you will want more clients that will pay for your services.\u00a0Being a startup, you have to push your idea forward into the market, and before you get noticed you need to market yourself in front of everyone. And by marketing, I am talking about displaying your product or service in front of people with money.To be successful, you need to pay less (of course because of the budget constraint), and still become the apple of everyone\u2019s eyes!\u00a0It is indeed true that money can buy an audience, but you have to be creative and bring in the \u201cout-of-the-box\u201d thinking into the play to impress them and make them your users.For that, you must learn how to rope-in every available channel of your business form promoting it to your audience.If your marketing strategies are played out well they will give you the intended result i.e., increased net revenue. But, if your marketing plan falters, then, it will be like throwing your money out in the trash.Being a startup owner, you will have to play multiple roles and while doing so, it is indeed difficult to learn the ropes of these roles. Not everyone has a natural knack of a seasoned sales or marketing professional.In this section, I will be sharing some crucial sales and marketing tips to help you earn more by spending less.1. Market the features, sell the benefitsYes, you are trying to tell how you are different from others in your domain so do it by highlighting what makes you different.\u00a0Here are the three major ways of doing so:\nCost: How do you price the product better than your competition?Quality: Showcase the best features, instead of bombarding all the featuresCombine: When you combine the cost with the quality you will show your worth to the audienceImportant note:As a startup owner, selling your product/service will be way different than how you market the same.For instance;You might tell a prospect that your product or service is cheaper than the competition.You might even say that it is more effective than your competitors.But the important point is, how you are going to showcase that your product or service is going to make the customer\u2019s life less complicated.In simple words, selling is about highlighting your product\u2019s benefit to the prospect and closing the deal on the basis of features.When you are comparing yourself with the competition, highlight the features but always sell your benefits.2. Know your audience and listen to themI am taking an example of Sam Walton here. As many of you know, he is the mind behind Walmart. It is not a hidden fact that Sam started Walmart in rural America. He went against the popular belief that a retailer in an area with a concentrated population will fail.Mr. Walton always listened to his customers. He knew that the audiences in the rural areas had large families. These families needed to stock their goods beforehand. He even knew that the small businesses in the area purchased their retail supplies in advance to be always stocked.Working as a team is what makes a product meaningful, avoids misunderstandings, saves time and money, and aligns expectations. The magic always tends to happen when everyone is sitting at one table \u2013 when each individual is able to blast out ideas that can make a startup grow quicker. These angles and solutions are much more diverse and interesting than just sticking to the \u201cbasics\u201d.The pandemic has changed the way you choose your target audience physically, but for the online audience, the metric has not changed on a grander scale (until you are an e-commerce site, allowed to deliver only the life-essential goods).3. Market your product properlyMany startups decide that one their product or service is ready to market, their marketing campaigns will follow suit. It\u2019s a costly mistake that often leads to heavy losses.Many others dream of cashing-in on the products by selling them post-production. Mind this fact: How will you make a sale if the prospects have never heard about your product or service?\u00a0This is simple economics. You start at zero demand and by the time you grab the audience\u2019s attention your losses are compiling at a faster rate.Start with a simple marketing campaign that is targeted at building your brand\u2019s awareness for attracting potential customers.Plan a minimal preemptive awareness campaign that will let your potential customers know that a new product is hitting the market soon.This way you have generated interest in the target audience and many of them will start out as your initial customer\u2019s when you are market-ready!4. Bring outside-the-box thinkingBack in the good-old-days when there were no search engines or social media platforms, people used traditional ways of marketing.Today, the marketing landscap"

They know how to formulate a plan to win the game and accordingly move the pieces to accomplish the plan.\u00a0Such winners aren\u2019t successful by coincidence; there are certain good habits that help them excel.\u00a0Success is the sum of small efforts \u2013 repeated day in and day out.\u00a05 habits that successful sales leaders possess\u00a0Remember the adage \u201cwith power comes responsibilities\u201d. The role of a leader is very enticing, but very few can do justice to this role. Those few become great sales leaders. They know how to guide their reps in the right direction to create a win-win situation.\u00a0Leadership is not a position or a title, it is action and example.\u2013 Donald McGannonLeading a team is indeed a great responsibility and there are certain things that need to be done right to succeed. The difficulty level in sales is increasing at a great pace, so the sales team needs a leader who can keep them on the right track.\u00a061% of salespeople say selling is harder or much harder today than it was 5 years ago.Effective sales leader\u2019s Habit 1 \u2013 Provide feedbackEffective sales leaders aim to grow. Not alone, but with their team. So, they invest time in providing regular feedback to bring the necessary improvements in their teams.\u00a0Successful sales leader refers to sales reports for evaluating their reps. After gathering necessary insights, they provide honest feedback to the sales reps.\u00a0Feedback helps reps in seeing the gaps in their performance. As a leader, you need to make the reps aware of the gaps so that they can fill them to achieve the team\u2019s sales goals.\u00a0Think about this, didn\u2019t you try to improve when someone gave you feedback? At times we need someone to point out flaws that are obstructing our growth. When the hurdles are visible, we can find out ways to overcome them or else we\u2019ll keep facing failures.\u00a0It isn\u2019t wrong to give constructive criticism. However, it needs to be done in the right way. Feedback contributes to increased productivity and better results. So, spare some time for sharing honest feedback with your sales reps.\u00a0Effective sales leader\u2019s habit 2 \u2013 Building team spirit\u00a0Achieving sales goals becomes more challenging when the team\u2019s morale is low. Effective sales leaders understand this, and so they create a positive environment to keep the sales reps motivated.\u00a0Often failure, internal team conflict, and customer criticism demotivate the sales reps. Successful sales leaders give equal attention to each sales rep in the team. If some external factor is affecting an individual\u2019s work, then they try to find out the root cause and provide necessary guidance.Like these successful leaders, you need to be available for your sales reps and boost their confidence when things go wrong.\u00a0Having experience in the field, you know that sales is unpredictable. Anything might happen at any moment.There is pressure.Prospects don\u2019t reply.\u00a0Targets are missed.\u00a0Lucrative deals fall at the final stage.\u00a0Such situations negatively impact sales rep\u2019s morale. As a sales leader, you need to implement a strategy to improve your sales reps\u2019 morale.\u00a0Besides, do little things to make your sales rep happier, more enthusiastic, and productive.\u00a0Like,Have team outings to cheer up the sales rep.\u00a0Acquaint them with the best CRM software and project management tool that makes their work easier.\u00a0Reward the best performers.Give your team occasional surprises.\u00a0Introduce a deal closure bell, that sales reps can ring when they win a deal and share their achievement with others.It is literally true that you can succeed best and quickest by helping others to succeed.\u2013 Napoleon Hill\u00a0Effective sales leader\u2019s habit 3 \u2013 Coaching regularly\u00a0Effective sales leaders don\u2019t just stop after the initial training. For them, training is a continuous process. The customers are becoming smarter with the plethora of information as well as reviews available on the internet. The competitors are experimenting with different sales strategies to attract customers. Sales reps require continuous coaching to tackle rising competition.\u00a0Companies that provide an optimal amount of coaching realize 16.7 % greater annual revenue growth.Being the captain of the ship as a sales leader, you need to navigate your sales team in the right direction.\u00a0Good training doesn\u2019t only empower the sales reps but also cuts down unproductive hours. It helps in minimizing easily avoidable mistakes and boosts confidence.\u00a0In sales, most of the reps often require training for handling difficult sales situations. So, conduct mock calls.

            "title": "Sales and customer service have more in common than you might think",
            "content": "Sales and customer service were once considered completely different areas of business \u2013 divided into two different departments, each having different goals, objectives, and strategies.Traditionally, sales teams would bring in new customers, while customer service teams were expected to take care of them.\u00a0Though both contributed towards bringing profits\u00a0to the company, they ultimately used different methods, often contrasting to each other.For quite a long time this concept has been accepted by many businesses, however, that currently isn\u2019t the case.As today we are seeing more and more data showing how customer service \u2013 whether done right or wrong \u2013 is making a big impact on sales, the traditional boundaries between sales and customer service are becoming more blurred and less important.In fact, sales and customer service really shouldn\u2019t be thought of as separate entities anymore.5 major things sales and customer service have in commonWhen reduced to their typical job definitions, sales and customer service employees seem to have two very different roles. And yet there is more overlap between them than most people might think. Below are the 5 basic things that sales and customer service actually have in common.1. They work towards creating a positive customer experienceAt the most basic level, salespeople are responsible for getting the customer in the door, while customer service agents are accountable for what happens after a sale is made.In a broader sense, though, they are both working towards achieving a single goal \u2013 creating a positive experience for customers.\u00a0Experience is what customers feel and go through when interacting with your business. The whole experience starts with your sales reps who help customers find and choose the right product or service that fulfills their needs.Then, your customer service reps help ensure that customers make the most out of the purchased products or services and have a seamless experience while using them.\u00a0In essence, this means that sales and customer service are basically on the same page when it comes to customer success and delivering positive customer experiences.2. Both are responsible for building customer relationshipsSales and customer service teams spend more time working with customers than anyone else in your business \u2013 and they both contribute to building long-term customer relationships.The days when salespeople could close a deal easily and never interact with a customer again are long gone. How today\u2019s salespeople deal with customers is becoming more relational and less transactional.Just like customer service reps, sales agents contribute to creating and maintaining relationships with customers by getting to know them, learning about their needs, and helping them find solutions to their problems.Ideally, both customer service agents and sales reps should continue nurturing customer relationships throughout the whole customer life cycle.\u00a03. Customer service directly affects salesSome of the most customer-centric organizations like Zappos, Amazon, and Apple have already realized the value of focusing their efforts on delivering outstanding service and letting it drive future sales. Customer service has truly become the new sales engine \u2013 it\u2019s the fact that is backed by numerous studies.\u00a0The NewVoiceMedia\u2019s research found that if provided with good service, 66% of consumers would be more loyal, 65% would be willing to recommend the company to others, 48% would spend more money, and 39% would use the business more frequently.On the flip side, when faced with poor customer service, 39% of consumers would never purchase from the company again.\u00a0Dissatisfied customers are not just walking out on businesses, they are slamming the door \u2013 and sharing their negative experiences extensively.\u00a0 In fact, negative word-of-mouth can damage a brand\u2019s reputation so much that it causes potential customers to look for alternatives.Moreover, the above-mentioned survey revealed that poor customer service is actually costing businesses more than $75 billion a year.\u00a0The correlation is clear: good customer service creates happier customers, repeat purchases, more brand loyalty, and more sales. And the opposite is just as true: bad customer service leads to customer frustration, no repeat business, bad word-of-mouth, customer churn, and lost sales.4. Customer service can be a profit center, tooCustomer service has been historically viewed as a cost center and a \u2018necessary evil\u2019, while sales has always been a profit center. That concept has greatly shifted over the past years as many businesses have come to realize that with the right strategy, customer service can actually become a profit center too.\u00a0When customer service teams are equipped with smart tools, like help desk software that keeps track of all customer communications across all touchpoints in a single place, it provides support agents with comprehensive customer insights.This means that agents can easily acces"

By response, we don\u2019t necessarily mean to reply to the message. We mean to take the action that you desire. That might be to visit a landing page, download an eBook about your product, or respond to your inquiry.The open and response rates for your email sequences, therefore, are vital metrics. You want them both to be as high as possible. We\u2019re going to teach you how to use a trio of straightforward elements to help you get there. Those are emojis, GIFs, and videos. First, though, let\u2019s explain why we\u2019re talking about email sequences and not one-off messages.Why you should use an email sequence in sales?When you reach out to a person by email, your ultimate aim is to get them to take action. You may want them to upgrade a subscription, to buy a new product, or merely to open a dialogue with you.Whatever it is you want, the email recipient is likely to have objections (note the plural). There will be reasons in their mind why they don\u2019t want to take the action you\u2019re looking for from them.You need to overcome those objections. That\u2019s why it\u2019s crucial to use email sequences. You can design and even automate series designed to hit multiple pain points and overcome many objections. Consider the following example:The flowchart depicts a simplified email sequence. It could be something you send to qualified leads or for sales follow-up to existing customers.\u00a0In your first email, you\u2019d highlight a specific pain point and explain how your service solves the problem. You layout your service\u2019s features and could even include a link to a video tutorial of how to use them.The next message would then quantify the benefit the recipient may get from working with you. It does that by sharing prior results and a case study showing how you\u2019ve helped a client similar to the recipient.Finally, you send a closing email to push your contact on to the final action you wish them to take. In this case, that\u2019s to schedule a meeting to discuss working more closely together. In the last message, you\u2019ll want to engender some urgency in the recipient. Make them feel like they must get the meeting scheduled or fear missing out on the benefits you\u2019re offering.\u00a0Email sequences, therefore, are a great way of convincing contacts. They gradually break down barriers and bring recipients around. In no time you can have a customer renewing a subscription or upgrading to a new package or signing up for your service.\u00a0That is, though, only if they open and respond to each message as you intend. Let\u2019s get down to how you can use emojis, GIFs, and videos to ensure they do so.Why emojis are the perfect addition to your subject line?The first hurdle to effective email communication is getting recipients to open your messages. You can\u2019t get through to any contact if they send you straight to their junk folder. The principal weapon in your arsenal in this area is your subject line. It\u2019s what people use to decide if they\u2019ll even look at the rest of your message.\u00a0You need your subject lines to stand out, and to be appealing. They must make your emails seem like something a recipient will enjoy reading. Ideally, you want them to think of a message from you as a point of interest. That\u2019s rather than thinking of it as a commercial message, or worse, as spam.There was one message in particular that caught the eye, right? Amongst the sea of text that makes most messages look the same, the emoji is what grabbed your attention. We can say that with confidence because it\u2019s true for everyone.Pop an emoji or emoticon in your subject lines, and your open rates could soar. 56% of brands that do use emoticons in that way have higher open rates. It\u2019s something your business can\u2019t afford to neglect.\u00a0What\u2019s more, an increasing proportion of emails now get opened on mobile devices. With this in mind, it makes even more sense to use emojis. We\u2019re all tuned in to seeing smiley faces and other emoticons whenever we\u2019re on our phones.\u00a0As well as capturing attention, emojis make your messages friendlier. They look more like the emails we all get from friends and colleagues. That\u2019s often an advantage but does also mean you have to be careful.\u00a0Emoticons are, like all things, a tool in your arsenal. Use t"

By automating time-consuming tasks, you will get more hours for finding new projects.\u00a0For instance,\u00a0Think about the time you spend on follow-up. Without understanding the clients\u2019 requirements, you cannot send a proposal. But sadly prospects don\u2019t reply easily, and so you need to follow-up consistently. There are chances you might forget to follow-up, and some other contractors might make the most of the opportunity.\u00a0Most of the construction CRM allows you to automate such tasks. You can easily create a sequence of emails and texts in the CRM and put your follow-up on autopilot.\u00a0So, don\u2019t miss out on this useful feature while selecting construction CRM software.\u00a04.

The first thing you want is a box of tissue.\u00a0Someone with an OCD has arranged a hundred boxes of tissue in a fine manner. You can see so many brands, so many colors, so many designs of tissue boxes.But, you pick one and turn it around\u2026..And look at the price tag.The guy with OCD has tried so hard to arrange all the boxes facing front, but we are more interested in the backside. Because it is our natural instinct to look at pricing.Obviously, we will think about pricing when it comes to business decisions. And without a doubt, we will think about money when it comes to one of the biggest business decisions \u2013 choosing the right CRM.\u00a0Affordability is one of the most important factors while choosing a CRM for your business. If the CRM has everything you need but the price is at the rooftop, it won\u2019t work out. The same way, if the CRM checks the pricing box and features don\u2019t make sense to you, that won\u2019t work out either.You have to find the perfect balance between features and pricing when choosing a CRM. And this article is exactly about it.\u00a0How to choose the most affordable CRM for your business?In order to choose an inexpensive CRM for your business, you need to prepare a set of requirements \u2013 things that will be helpful to you while making a decision.Here are some of the most common parameters to consider:1. The primary features you are looking for.2. The secondary features you are looking for.3. No. of users of the CRM.4. How much money are you willing to spend on CRM? (Minimum and maximum)Now, primary features are the ones that you can\u2019t afford to compromise. These are the features that will directly solve the problems your business is facing right now. Things like Pipeline Management or Workflow Management.The secondary features are the ones that can enhance your CRM experience and offer advanced functionality. Things like Automated Sequences or Shared Team Inbox. These features will bring additional values to your business.\u00a0Since every CRM comes with Dollar/User pricing, you need to consider every employee who will use the system. Some businesses make compromises here, but it will honestly make things hard for you.\u00a0Lastly, pricing. How much money are you willing to spend on the CRM. People often decide the number of users after choosing the CRM, but it should be the opposite. After choosing the number of users, you can get a real-time idea of the pricing.\u00a0So, a system that checks all these 4 boxes is the most affordable CRM for you.\u00a0But the process is not that simple. You will get distracted in between.Free CRM \u2013 Your distractionDo not rush just because it\u2019s FREETrust me, I am not trying to sell you anything!\u00a0A free plan is a genius marketing strategy to make you familiar and habituate with a system. Once your information is stored in the free CRM, and you have already been using the system for a while, you will switch to the paid plan, rather than finding a new one.As a marketing guy, I do appreciate this idea. But as a decision-maker, I may not like this.\u00a0I won\u2019t be choosing that free CRM because of its features and functionality. I wouldn\u2019t stick to such CRM because it would cost me a fortune to migrate all the data to a new CRM.The idea of free CRM is a marketing genius but can be a huge pain for the customers. That\u2019s why most CRM has started providing free trials of their products. So, customers can check the system out, use every feature, and then make an informed decision.The second problem with free CRM is its limitations. I understand the motive of providing a free CRM can be good \u2013 to help businesses get on their feet. But the limited features restrict them in more than one way. In some cases, businesses with potential can not grow because they are restricted by the limitations of the features.It is a smart move to invest in a CRM rather than looking for a free one!Simple process to choose an inexpensive CRM for your businessWhen you go for the hunt of the most affordable CRM for your business, you will end up with 3-4 options that look attractive to you.Here is the most simple process you can follow to choose the best option for your business.

It isn\u2019t that easy.The difficulty in the sales field is escalating at a great pace.There are many things that startups aren\u2019t aware of when it comes to selling, which is why most of them fail to survive for long in the business world. They hire a few sales reps, set unrealistic expectations, and then fire them when they don\u2019t get the returns from their investments.Selling is difficult, but it isn\u2019t impossible if you do a few things right. Many success stories of early-stage startups like Uber, Airbnb, and Facebook have been growing into multi-billion-dollar companies.\u00a0Sales is just like a puzzle. You need to put the piece in the right places to succeed.Essential sales facts for startupsYou\u2019ve sown the startup seed; now it\u2019s time to nurture and bloom it.Besides keeping yourself abreast with the latest market trends, there is a lot that you need to know to sell successfully and grow your business.Here are some of the sales facts that need your attention.Sales fact 1: You need to focus on the customersCustomer-centric companies are 60% more profitable compared to companies that are not focused on the customer. \u2013 SalesmateMore sales lead to more revenue, which is what most startup owners look for in the early years of their business.Yes, you need to go higher on the sales graph. But for that, you need \u201ccustomers\u201d.Most startups are so engrossed in selling their product that they give less attention to the prospective buyer\u2019s problems.Several people buy a product to address a specific issue. Without understanding the potential buyers\u2019 business pain points, it would be difficult to convince them to invest in your product.If you don\u2019t provide the help the potential buyers expect, then they will look for other alternatives. And we cannot forget the competitors who are just looking for an opportunity to get ahead.If you don\u2019t take care of your customer, your competitor will.\u2013 Bob HooeySo, build a customer-centric culture in your startup. First, discover the prospects\u2019 goals, problems, and challenges. Once the prospects\u2019 requirements are clear, present your product as a solution explaining how it can help fulfill their needs.Sales fact 2: Prospecting should be strategizedHalf of all sales time is spent on ineffective prospecting. \u2013 LSA InsiderProspecting isn\u2019t just about making a list of random numbers and email ids and cold calling or emailing them.Several startups don\u2019t plan their prospecting, so they lose most of the leads in the initial phase.Sales prospecting done wrong can result in wasting time, money, and resources, especially for a startup, which often outsources its leads from a digital marketing agency.Effective prospecting is essential for driving more sales, so ensure you plan your startup\u2019s sales prospecting.\u00a0Make sure you create a buyer persona before you even start with prospecting.Familiarise your sales reps with your product\u2019s benefits and how it can help your target audience.Ask your sales reps to research the prospects before analyzing them.Explore different channels for prospecting like social media sites and videos, along with calls and emails.Set a specific time for prospecting.Create and use sales scripts for prospecting but ensure your sales reps don\u2019t read word to word.Sales fact 3: Follow ups are essential\u00a044% of salespeople give up after the first follow-up call. \u2013 SalesmateMost startups are in a rush to close deals. They want to bring in customers as soon as possible. So, if one prospect isn\u2019t responding, the sales rep will start focusing on the other lead in the pipeline. Due to this, most deals have stalled at a single stage of the sales pipeline for a long time.\u00a0Consistent follow-up is essential to move the deals inside the sales pipeline. Encourage your sales reps to follow up at certain intervals.\u00a0Ask them not to get discouraged when the prospects don\u2019t reply to the follow-up emails. There are chances that the prospects might be busy.\u00a0However, you and your sales reps should keep proper gaps between the follow-up emails.\u00a0Make your sales reps work easier by implementing CRM software that doesn\u2019t only helps in managing sales but also puts the tedious task of following up with prospects on autopilot.\u00a0You can add as many steps as you like and create an automated sequence of follow-up emails inside a CRM system.

Interestingly, everyone from board members and CEOs to Legal to Risk to IT claims responsibility for a variety of crisis roles \u2014 preparedness, response, recovery, ERM, communications. This tells us that most senior executives want to be involved in helping their companies prepare for and respond to the crisis, which is a positive sign. \u2013 PwC Global Crisis Survey 2019 Crisis is the time that can change every dynamic of your business. It can change the formation of teams, roles of team members, faces of leadership, even the business model of your product or service.A crisis is probably the worst time for any business that can force you to make quick decisions, rapidly shift your production and marketing efforts, and drastically reduce your sales.\u00a0In this article, we are talking about what we can do before, during, and after the crisis. This article will help you in designing the right strategy for the crisis.Let\u2019s start with understanding the kind of crisis that can hover on your business and sales:The diversity of crisisAll the crises will fall under one or more of these 7 essential categories:1. Operational2. Technological3. Humanitarian4. Financial5. Legal6. Human capital7. ReputationalExamples of crisis a business might faceAs a business owner or a sales leader, these are the kinds of crises that can come your way.\u00a0Let\u2019s look at some examples:Churn of some of your most valuable customersProbably a huge portion of your revenue comes from a handful of star customers. This is an ideal scenario for many businesses. But if your team fails to provide the right product or service to such customers time after time, these customers can leave on an immediate basis and leave you in a condition of crisis.An important member may leave the teamBusinesses do take a lot of care in this segment so the teams don\u2019t have to suffer. But this situation can still occur at any given time. An important member or the leader can leave the team or company for any reason.\u00a0This particular person handles an important aspect of your business and suddenly everything seems clueless.\u00a0Budget cutdownsThe management may cut down the budget of a particular team, but you still have the responsibility of delivering the expected results. Such crises can force you to find new approaches in a limited amount of time, and that can be overwhelming.Missing a series of targetsIt is a painful situation even when your team misses their monthly sales quota. Imagine the kind of impact it can make when you miss a series of targets. That means the revenue machine of your business has stopped, and there\u2019s a direct question on your survival.A major cutdown in manpowerWithout manpower, it is impossible to achieve your business goals. We just talked about the impact an important person can make after leaving your team. Imagine a huge portion of teammates leaving the organization.\u00a0Situations like this happen when the manpower is not happy with the business or the leadership. We often get the news about factory workers on strike!A global crisisSome crises are completely out of your control and will leave you feeling completely powerless. The recent example of COVID-19 is the best example of such crises. A global crisis will affect your nation, industry, business, even your employees, leaving you in great confusion about what to do next.How to act when then the crisis is comingIn some cases, you will identify the crisis in advance but in some cases, it will be a total surprise. For the crises that you can identify a while ago, there are certain things you can do:1. Be honest with your teammatesYour teammates are the most valuable assets to you in the time of any crisis. If you are lucky enough to identify the crisis, share the most important details with them.Make sure they don\u2019t feel panicked. Listen to their concerns about the future of the company, their job security, and changes in their roles.As a leader, your job is to educate the team with new approaches and prepare for the coming storm.2. Take ideas and discuss your approachEvery new idea is important. You never know what approach will be useful to your business in the crisis.Simply ask for new ideas to your teammates and let them take initiatives in the right direction. Come up with your own approach and discuss the possibilities with your teammates. Choose the best approach after discussing every idea and move ahead to pitch to the management.Make a note that the management has to handle every aspect of the business. Coming up with multiple solutions will only create more confusion. It\u2019s best to discuss your finest plan, and keep every other plan as alternatives.3. Discuss the approach with the managementIt is obvious that you have to discuss your strategy for the crisis with the management. Present all the sides of your strategy. Basically, the management should get the answers to these questions from your presentation:1. What is the mo"

However, the question is how many out of them were successful?Sales call failures are the root causes of many lost deals.\u00a0Sales call is one of the main communication channels used to interact with potential buyers.\u00a092% of all customer interactions take place over the phone\u00a0\u2013 Salesmate\u00a0Sales reps tend to make many mistakes while selling over the phone and give prospects a reason to explore the competitor\u2019s products.\u00a0If you too are one of them, then it is high time that you give those mistakes attention before dialing your prospect\u2019s number.\u00a0Sales call mistakes you must avoid\u00a0So, what are those sales calls mistakes that are driving away the prospects and affecting your conversions?To help you I\u2019ve mentioned a few common ones below:\u00a0Sales call mistake 1 \u2013 Reading from a scriptYou call the prospect, and after the opening statement, you commence reading from a sales script.\u00a0Put yourself in the prospect\u2019s shoes and think, what you would have done if someone sounded so robotic.\u00a0Yawn or rather hang up?Prospects prefer to speak to someone who understands their problem and provide a solution to it.For that, you need to have a meaningful conversation with the prospect. I am not saying you shouldn\u2019t have a sales script.A sales script helps you in staying on the right track. But make sure it just has the essential points rather than the lengthy narrative.Keep the sales script for your reference to ensure you don\u2019t miss out on something important. But don\u2019t read it word to word.Sales call mistake 2 \u2013 Pitching before you build a rapport\u00a0Yes, you are in a hurry to reach your sales targets. Your aim is to close the deals as soon as possible. However, that doesn\u2019t mean you straightway start speaking about the strengths and benefits of your product.\u00a0It will fall on deaf ears. The prospect might be polite enough to listen to you once, but there are chances they might not receive your call again.You surely wouldn\u2019t want to do that as it might put an end to the deal.So, establish a relationship with your prospects before you start speaking all good things about your product.Focus on the customers and try to make them comfortable. Research about them before making the discovery call so that you can speak about things that interest them. Then gradually know about their requirements as well as challenges and try to help them. Act as a consultant and guide them with the path they should be treading to fulfill the needs and overcome the issues.Know what your customers want most and what your company does best. Focus on where those two meet. \u2013 Kevin StirtzSales call mistake 3 \u2013 Scanty or not at all questioningThe more information you gather, the better you can help your prospects. For that, you need to ask relevant questions to your prospects.Questions are a valuable tool to amass information that can help you during the closure.Here are a few questions that you should be asking your prospects-What are your goals for this year?What\u2019s holding you back from achieving those goals?Is overcoming this obstruction a priority at present?Tell me more about the problem?Do you have anything in mind to resolve this issue?What does a good solution look like to you?What budget is available for fixing this issue?Sales call mistake 4- Pretending to know something you don\u2019tWell, there are many writing platforms on the Internet if you are good at storytelling. Do not use this skill negatively on a sales call when you don\u2019t have the answer to the question a prospect has asked.You may say something that your company doesn\u2019t offer, and later while closing the deal the prospect might point that out in the contract. So, you might land up in trouble. Oh, let me rephrase it. You might probably lose the deal.So do not make these sales call mistakes.Be honest with your prospects. If you aren\u2019t sure about something, then take some time and tell the prospect you will get back to them. But do not cook up stories, saying \u201cwe can do this\u201d and \u201cwe can do that\u201d.Sales call mistake 5 \u2013 Inadequate preparationMost of the sales calls fail because the sales reps aren\u2019t prepared.You just get a few minutes on a sales call to capture the prospect\u2019s interest; if you fail to impress, there are fewer chances that the prospect might speak to you again.So, ensure you prepare before you call your prospects.If you\u2019ve recorded your sales calls, then listen to them and identify the problem areas. Create a list of the major objections you are facing while selling over the phone. Find out ways to deal with those objections.Focus on your tone and pace. Are you speaking too fast, or are you unclear to your prospects?Find that out and work on it. Ensure you sound confident while speaking to the prospect.Have a mock call session with a senior who is experienced in handling difficult sales situations.\u00a0Ask him to put forth various sales objections and guide you when you get stuck"

Ask these questions to yourself.What is a Sales Process?Your sales process is a template that guides you towards achieving your sales objectives. It also helps you in creating the benchmark of performance that you desired from your sales team members.Creating a sales process is important as it allows you to develop a repeatable series of steps that the members of your sales team need for successful conversation.What is an effective sales process?The steps of your sales process consist of separate selling activities. Here is a typical view of how the steps in a startup sales process might look like.1. Customer-centricModern buyers are resourceful, well-informed and array of options. As a startup, you must align your sales processes accordingly.2. Clearly definedMake sure that everyone involved in your business completely understands each of the stages and elements of your sales process.3. ReplicableYour sales reps must be so well-versed with the sales process that they can easily replicate each of its steps.4. PredictableThere needs to be a certain amount of predictability in the flow and the expected outcomes of your sales process.5. Goal-orientedYour sales process must be planned for improving the achievement of certain activities, e.g, drive your company\u2019s revenue growth, achieve better sales efficiencies, etc).6. MeasurableThe activities in your sales process must be measurable for gauging the success and scope of improvement.7. AdaptableStartup owners must create a flexible sales process for accommodating the dynamic market, tech innovations, or the changes in your own way of operations.If you successfully create a sales process with these points in mind, it will easily align with the purchasing journey of your prospects. Meaning you will focus on their needs by eradicating your own greed!What\u2019s the difference between sales process and sales methodology?There has been confusion (especially among non-sales professionals) over these two terms. While they might sound synonymous, they refer to two different things in the sales universe.Sales methodology\u00a0is the framework or philosophy that guides how a salesperson approaches each step within the sales process. You may adopt a single methodology to govern your entire sales process or apply different methodologies in each step of the sales process.What are the important sales process stages for a startup?I will be focusing on the most crucial sales process stages every startup must focus to get the desired result.1. ResearchSalespeople must have a good idea about their product, target customers, industry, and the unique value the band is providing to the market. The foundation of your sales process must be solid.Research about the competition. What are you going to offer them that will stand apart from the rest?Stand in your customer\u2019s shoes.

            "title": "5 things sales reps can learn from TED Talk videos",
            "content": "Have you ever got an intellectual adrenaline rush? The experience when you were enlightened with something and were curious to dig deeper into that specific subject to know more. Well, this happens to many people while watching a TED Talk video.The three-decade-old business of talking has influenced many and offered a plethora of information on different subjects. As a sales rep, you can pick up a lot of things from these TED Talk videos that can help you in achieving your sales targets.\u201cAn investment in knowledge pays the best interest\u201d \u2013 Benjamin FranklinFive vital things to learn from TED Talk videosWhat do you do during the dead time while commuting to work or waiting for a client? Check your Whatsapp messages or scroll through Instagram or Facebook. Well, you can invest that time in watching a few TED Talk videos.Below are the things you can learn from the TED Talk videos:1. How to stay calm in stressful situations?Stress is your biggest opponent in sales. The stressed mind tends to do things that lead to serious repercussions. For instance, you might make errors while creating a proposal or squander an opportunity by making blunders during a sales call.Sales is a game of calm mind. You are not at your best when you are stressed. So, take a deep breath and stay calm. There is always a way to deal with stressful situations. This is what even Daniel Levitin emphasizes in his TED Talk\u00a0 \u201cHow to stay calm when you know you\u2019ll be stressed\u201d. He thinks there\u2019s a way to avoid making mistakes in stressful situations.Quoting Daniel Levitin-\u201cone of the things that goes out the window during those times of stress is rational, logical thinking. So, we need to train ourselves to think ahead to these kinds of situations.I think the important point here is recognizing that all of us are flawed. We all are going to fail now and then.The idea is to think ahead to what those failures might be, to put systems in place that will help minimize the damage, or to prevent the bad things from happening in the first place.\u201d2. Why is listening important?It might be enticing to speak about the strengths of your product. But while doing that, you need to even listen to the problems of your prospects. Listening is an essential skill in sales.The top sales performers talk for 46% of a call, which means they listen for at least 54% of it.Till you don\u2019t listen to your prospects, you can\u2019t discover their problems. If you don\u2019t find out about their problems, it would be difficult to present your product as a solution.So, it is pivotal to listen to your potential buyers as it helps in establishing and nurturing a relationship.In the TED Talk\u00a0 \u201cThe Power of Listening\u201d William Ury explains why listening is important. He asks us to join a listening revolution and assures that if we all just listen a little bit more, we can transform any relationship.Quoting Willian Ury \u2013\u201cListening may be the golden key that opens the door to human relationships.How do we listen? It turns out that we often take listening for granted as something easy and natural. But in fact, at least in my experience, real genuine listening is something that needs to be learned and practiced every day.In ordinary listening, we\u2019re hearing the words. We\u2019re often thinking, \u201cWhere do I agree? Where do I disagree? What am I going to say in response?\u201d In other words, the focus is on us.In genuine listening, however, the spotlight moves to the other person.We put ourselves in their shoes. We tune in to their wavelength. We listen from within their frame of reference, not just ours. That\u2019s not easy.In genuine listening, we listen not just to what\u2019s being said, but for what\u2019s not being said.We listen not just the words, but to what\u2019s behind the words.We listen for the underlying emotions, feelings, and needs.We listen for what that person really needs or wants.\u201d3. How to stay on the path of success?Few of the sales reps stop putting in efforts once they achieve their monthly or quarterly sales targets.They feel they\u2019ve understood the sales game and can play it well now. Sadly, due do this overconfidence, most of them fail to meet their targets in the next quarter.Well, sales is a field where you need to prove yourself continuously. If you slow down, your competitors might surpass you. So, you need to stay on your toes in this competitive industry. Keep exploring new strategies and different sales methodologies to convert your prospects into paying customers. You can\u2019t stop trying, once you taste success.In the TED Talk, \u201cSuccess is a Continuous Journey\u201d Richard ST. John has stated ways to achieve and sustain success. Through this TED Talk, he tries to remind us that success is not a one-way street; it is a constant journey. When we stop trying, we fail.Quoting Richard St. John \u2013\u201cWhy do so many people reach success and then fail? One of the big reasons is, we think success is a one-way street. So, we do everything that leads up to success, but then we get there. We figure we\u2019ve made it"

            "title": "Bad sales habits that are hurting your sales productivity",
            "content": "Bad sales habits! Yes, you read that right. At some point in your life, as a sales professional, you pick up habits that seem perfect at that moment.You never see this coming, and these habits start having a negative effect on your sales productivity. Sales professionals will even accept this guilt of developing bad sales habits under their breath.Some of us have had more grave problems than others and some have taken more time to overcome them. But, the truth remains the same. Bad sales habits are almost an inevitable part of being a sales professional.In short, bad sales habits draw us away from our goals and deter us from performing our tasks smoothly and efficiently. The most efficient salespeople are those who seldom get carried away by bad sales habits. They work in a smart manner every day of the week to enhance their sales productivity.Here are some of the most commonly found bad sales habits that sales professionals must avoid.1. Lack of Planning\u201cAround 8% of salespeople get 80% of the sales.\u201dHaving a clear set plan of action is crucial for a sales manager. What\u2019s more important is that you must never let the circumstances let you drive your day.Rather set your priorities and act accordingly.Here\u2019s the golden rule! Whenever you leave for home, keep you tomorrow\u2019s tasks ready. You must have a plan of action for your entire week, month, and quarter.Of course, things may change on your daily schedule, but if you have your priorities for the day, it will help you accomplish more things on an everyday basis.Having a plan is always helpful in creating an environment that is driven with sales productivity as its focal point.2. Not using a CRM softwareThe most popular sales tools include CRM, social prospecting, data and list services, email engagement, phone, and sales cadence (Sales for Life).CRM has become an integral part of any business, whether a small one or an enterprise. Since every business is using some kind of CRM, it would be a big mistake if you don\u2019t utilize one.An efficient sales professional can use CRM to fetch, create, and get in touch with their contacts using a CRM system. Modern CRM systems have built-in calling features that can be used by sales reps for timely follow-ups.With automated sequences, you can up your sales productivity. Set up a series of emails that can take follow-up according to conditions set by you.CRM That is Designed To Work Your Way!Take our 15 days free trial.Try Salesmate NOW!3. Avoiding criticismSales professionals do have their fair share of flaws. And sometimes they don\u2019t even know it. Every sales professional has to go through the criticism part.They need to have patience and must not take the criticism in a negative way. They need criticism to guide them to get better.Positive criticism always pays well. Sales reps must know how to take all the positive and leaving the negative out.4. Ineffective follow-ups\u201c44% of sales reps give up after 1 follow-up\u201d \u2013 SalesmateAs a sales professional, you will agree that the most critical part of your daily activity is to follow-up on your daily sales calls, emails and appointments.Sometimes even the most talented and hard-working sales reps fail to achieve their sales targets. And sometimes they lose their prospects because of unsuccessful follow-ups.Sales reps are not going to lose their bad sales habits of not following up without a little help from modern-day sales CRM.Proper follow-up leads to more information about the prospect\u2019s need. Every detail taken into consideration helps shape the deal into a close.Following up with your prospects over a call or text, email is counted as the nicest habit a sales rep can develop to become productive.Design Your Dream Email Sequence \ud83d\udce8With stages & conditions you like!Try Salesmate for Free5. Give prospecting a miss\u201cAround 80% of salespeople who fail, do so because they don\u2019t prospect.\u201dEvery sales rep has to hone the skill of prospecting. Prospecting is important for your sales process.The goal of prospecting is to develop a database of potential customers and then communicate with them in a systematic manner in the hopes of converting them into paying customers.Sometimes the prospects you talk to won\u2019t be ready to make a purchase. This is not the point where you give up on them.They might not be financially ready to pay for your services. Or they might not have the need for your solution at the moment.They also might not be aware that they need your solution. This is where prospecting skills come into play.Use your CRM software as a tool to keep your prospects educated and informed about the latest feature or integration that you have done. You never know, the prospect might ping you for another round.6. Not prepping for objectionsObjections are part and parcel of sales. Prospects will object to your sales pitch, your timing of the calls, your pricing, your features, etc.Sales reps make a grave mistake of not preparing the answers or way around to the probable objections pros"

There have been experiments on the way businesses can grow their revenue cycle.In this article, we will be explaining one of the sales methodologies, i.e., N.E.A.T. Selling\u2122.So, what Does N.E.A.T. Selling\u2122 Stand For?Every letter in the N.E.A.T. Selling\u2122 acronym is a guiding principle or framework.The methodology intends to guide sales professionals while selling.NeedsThis is where sales professionals understand the importance of finding out the needs of prospects.They also get to know understanding the pain points the prospects have.Once the prospects find out whether they could benefit from your product or not, it is easy for them to make a purchase.Economic impactHere, the prospect must be allowed to understand the financial impact their decision will have on their problem.The aim of this point is to show the financial benefit of choosing your solution.Access to authorityYour sales process gets delayed because many times, sales reps are not able to reach the decision-maker.Having a direct conversation with the decision-maker is essential to move the prospect ahead in your sales process.In this part, sales professionals understand the importance of reaching decision-makers or someone who has influence over making the final purchase, early in the sales process.TimelineIn this section, sales professionals will learn why it is crucial for them to create a timeline of their sales process and why they must achieve sales in the set timeframe.N.E.A.T. sales qualification method promotes active listeningIf your sales professionals are going out there to close a number in their spreadsheet or make sales pitch to a prospect, they will probably fail.N.E.A.T. sales emphasize on the fact that sales professionals must listen carefully to the prospect.Listening to the problems of prospects helps sales professionals delve deep into their needs.Ever felt like your sales reps have a bad reputation!The most likely reason for this situation is that your prospects feel they are interacting with a radio or cassette player.Or maybe the sales reps who have \u201cconversation\u201d with the prospect are more driven by the completion of their quota than understanding the prospects\u2019 needs.No prospect wants to feel like a number! And no ones like getting interrogated!Help your sales professionals learn the art of shifting focus.Help them understand how and when they must tap the pause button and hit the \u201clisten\u201d button.\u00a0In this section, we are going to provide a small N.E.A.T. sales methodology training.We will also show you why N.E.A.T. sales methodology is ideal for a sales organization.In other words, you can say that N.E.A.T.

            "content": "Type \u2018business reviewing sites\u2019 on Google\u2019s search and it will give you many results such as G2 Crowd, SiteJabber, Capterra, Yelp, HundredX, Manta, Zomato, TripAdvisor.Oh, there are seriously too many reviewing sites for anything and everything on the internet. Besides these sites, how can we forget the popular social media sites like Facebook and Twitter, where hundreds of customers post their positive and negative feedback.The smart buyers prefer going through these reviews before making a purchase.72% of customers\u00a0won\u2019t act until they read reviewsThere is no doubt that in today\u2019s modern business world, a review can make or break a sales deal. If the reviews are good, you won\u2019t face much difficulty in closing a deal. But God forbid if the reviews are bad, then you might be in a little trouble.Yes, bad reviews will increase the difficulty level, but that doesn\u2019t mean you cannot sell a product.Many companies receive negative reviews for their products, but they don\u2019t quit selling. They acknowledge it. Below is an example of how JetBlue responded to the review of an unhappy customer.So, don\u2019t get disappointed when you hear something like, \u201cI researched your product and read some negative reviews about it\u201d.Tackle this objection of a potential prospect smartly. It is undoubtedly possible to gain your potential buyer\u2019s trust and close deals even if you have negative reviews.Before we get to that, let\u2019s look at some do\u2019s and don\u2019t that will help you in tackling this sales objection regarding bad reviews.Do\u2019s and don\u2019ts that needs your attentionHere are a few things you must do or avoid when a potential buyer shares the bad reviews they\u2019ve heard or read about your product.Find the sourceWell, here you need to put in a little effort and find the source of the negative reviews.Was it a reviewing site, social networking platform, or a product comparison blog where the prospect read something negative about you?Or did someone from their contacts gave a negative feedback about your product?When you have the source, you\u2019ll be able to create a plan of action to deal with those bad reviews.For instance, if it\u2019s some fake review on a social media platform, then you can address it. If it\u2019s a genuine review with serious concern on a reviewing site, then you can apologize and work on the glitches.Address the bad reviewsMost of the businesses ignore the bad reviews and later suffer when that negative feedback obstructs their path to deal closure.So, it is pivotal to keep a tab on all the negative reviews and address them in real-time. If it isn\u2019t your fault then defend your product with full confidence.If there are some flaws in your product, then improve and inform the customer about the tweaks you\u2019ve done to improve the customer experience.Do not get discouragedMost sales reps go blank and fail to take the communication ahead when potential prospects speak about the bad reviews. Many get discouraged and lose enthusiasm when they hear this objection continuously.Well, sales is a game where you must remain self-motivated if you want to hit those monthly or quarterly targets.As a sales rep, you should believe in the product you are selling and present it as a strong solution to your prospects. You must divert their attention from the negative reviews to your product\u2019s strengths.Do not lose your coolFew of the sales reps get too defensive when they hear something negative about the product they\u2019re selling. Being too impulsive can affect sales.So, stay calm and think before you react. Or maybe don\u2019t react at that moment. Take some time to find out the truth and then return with a strong justification to gain their confidence.Close deals faster with Salesmate CRMFeature-rich sales solution with advanced capabilitiesTry Salesmate for FreeClose deals successfully despite the bad reviewsBad reviews are poisonous to your sales. However, poison does have an antidote. So find that antidote for your product\u2019s bad reviews. Be honest while defending or presenting an explanation for the bad reviews.Here are three antidotes for bad reviews objection.1. The reviews were fakeSome customers have unrealistic expectations. If they aren\u2019t fulfilled, these customers write negative reviews to ruin the image of your product.Sadly, potential buyers trust these reviews and form their own opinion of your product/services. This is why I had asked you to address each negative review that you come across about your product.The sad part is some of the companies do pay people to write fake reviews. Besides, there are even chances that your competitors might as well write something negative about your product or pay someone to do so.So, you need to make your prospects aware of these fake reviews.The other day I came across a Ted talk video \u201cThe future of lying\u201d by Jeff Hancock where he spoke about fake reviews.Quoting Jeff Hancock,\u201cThousands of people in China are paid small amounts of money to produce content.

It is as risky as the stock market.One mistake and you might lose your potential buyers to your competitors.Besides oodles of patience, you require a lot of information to make the right decisions.The best way of getting this information is through a sales report.A sales report is like a navigation tool. It not only shows where you are headed but also leads you in the right direction.You get a clear picture of what\u2019s going on in your company\u2019s sales and how your team is performing.With insightful graphs, it becomes easier to capture a large amount of information about anything and everything that can impact your profits.Why are sales reports so important?Well, most of the sales personnel will agree that converting a lead isn\u2019t an easy task.79% of leads never convert into sales.Many opportunities are missed, and several sales targets remain unfulfilled.Sales reps start the race of conversion with great enthusiasm, but they fail to reach the finish line.Businesses spend their precious dollars on hiring a winning sales team. So like investors of the stock market even they expect timely returns from such an investment.They would want to know what went wrong. Why are sales reps not meeting the sales quota?Sales leaders are answerable to management.So, it\u2019s necessary to find out if the sales teams are translating their efforts into real sales.If not, then what are the hurdles that are obstructing their path to success.15% of sales manager\u2019s time should be spent measuring performance and holding salespeople accountable.Sales reps are under pressure to reach their targets.So they are curious to know why are the prospects abandoning them?A sales report can help the top management, sales managers, and sales reps in answering all these questions.It is a data-driven approach that provides a more holistic view of the company\u2019s sales process, trends happening in the sales volume and overview of each sales rep\u2019s action.Sales reports track sales metrics that are important to improve the conversions.These insightful reports throw light on the sales team\u2019s performance.

Before we explore those essential sales reports, let\u2019s first focus on how to create them.Manage your sales seamlesslyView and keep track of your sales deals with Salesmate CRMTry Salesmate for FreeHow to create a sales report?The building wouldn\u2019t stand strong if the foundation is weak. Similarly, extra attention must be given while creating a sales report.If done properly, sales reports can provide crucial insights that can help in achieving the company\u2019s sales goals.Here is how you can create the best sales reports for drawing essential insights:1. Define the purpose of your sales reportYou might have to share quarterly sales reports with the top management.Or create a performance feedback report for your team.Both the sales reports will have different structures and information.So, be very specific.Why are you creating the sales report?\u201cWhat is the most important thing that you want to convey through your reports?\u201dThe purpose should be crystal clear to get the intended results.An extraordinary business starts with extraordinary people. Extraordinary people start with purpose. \u2013 Jesper Lowgren2. Time periodYou would want to know how many calls your sales reps made in a day or how meetings did he/she attend.For this, you\u2019ll need a daily report.You might want to monitor the changing purchase patterns or track the effectiveness of your sales strategies, for that you\u2019ll need a yearly sales report.Therefore, you will need to figure out what time period you want to focus on.It is essential to be clear whether it is a daily, monthly, or yearly sales report.Selecting a specific time period will help in performing more accurate timely sales comparisons.3. Collecting dataWithout relevant data, it is difficult to create a strong sales report that will provide vital insights.91% of businesses suffer from sales data error and that bad data is responsible for an average 12% loss of revenue.Sales reports aren\u2019t just about flashing some random numbers.Presenting relevant information in the right way will help in contextualizing and reinforcing trends as well as results.Monitor every aspect of your sales to ensure you don\u2019t miss out on important details. Track your sales metrics and organize your data in one place.4. Creating visuals and communicating your findingsToo much data can be difficult to digest. Simplify dense information by adding visuals"

            "title": "Challenger sales model: An in-depth understanding",
            "content": "In one of our previous articles, we talked about 7 tried and tested sales methodologies where we included the Challenger sales model in brief.This article is purely dedicated to that subject and we will explore it in a little bit of depth.This methodology is based on the book \u201cThe Challenger Sale\u201d by Brent Adamson and Matthew Dixon.What is the Challenger sales model?Challenger sales methodology talks about one of the five personality traits (personas) of sales reps i.e, Challengers:1. Relationship builders2. Hard workers3. Lone wolves4. Reactive problem solvers5. ChallengersChallengers sales reps are the ones who follow the T-T-T process (more on that later) and add a lot of value to their overall sales numbers.According to the authors of the book, 39% of the most successful sales reps are challengers. Challenger sales model talks about taking the less-traveled road of challenging the prospect and trying to disrupt their process for a good cause.You\u2019ll get a better idea when we understand the T-T-T process.What is the T-T-T process in sales?T-T-T stands for Teach-Tailor-Take control.First, the sales rep teaches or makes the prospect aware of a bigger problem or an idea. Something that the prospect is completely unaware of.Secondly, the sales rep tailors his sales process for the prospect. Everything from the sales pitch to negotiation. He makes sure the discussion is about the larger problem.Lastly, the rep takes charge of the entire conversation and offers his solution to the prospect at the right point.Brent Adamson, an author and VP of Gartner, states that the most preferred sales rep persona is \u201cRelationship Builder\u201d.This is obvious because this persona helps sales reps in building deeper bonds with prospects and customers. But, the relationship-building profile is found in only 7% of star performers.Building deeper relationships is extremely important, but this can be achieved using the Challenger sales model as well.As a sales rep, you will find some root problems for the prospect and suggest better solutions.I mean, that is a very strong base to build a relationship!So, what exactly does a Challenger sales rep do?A Challenger sales rep will disrupt the current ideology of the prospect for a good cause. Not to manipulate the prospect into buying his product, but to show them the mirror. A mirror that shows the actual-bigger problem that they are missing.It\u2019s like; you\u2019re facing a continuous pain in your lower back and you keep popping pills for it.A Challenger sales rep will show you that your back pain is actually caused by the sitting posture. Then, he will pitch a perfect chair that can solve your problem.In order to burst the bubble, you have to understand the prospect\u2019s business from the core and deduce the base problem. I believe this attitude of disruption comes from great practice.The next step is to come up with a tailored sales pitch and negotiation tactics. Everything from this point is purely dedicated to making the prospect understand the problem.When the prospect understands the negative impacts of this problem \u2013 that\u2019s your win!The third and the last step is to take charge of the conversation and offer your solution.A lot of sales reps put so much effort into being a good guy that they can\u2019t pitch the product at the right moment. And that\u2019s what makes the star sales reps stand out from the pack.Here\u2019s a short communication that can help you understand the Challenger sale methodology better:Ryan: Hello, am I talking to Mr. Jim from Visible Inc.?Jim: Yes, this is Jim. How can I help you?Ryan: Hey Jim, I\u2019m Ryan from Salesmate. Yesterday you signed up for our free trial. I would like to know more about your business, so I can help you with our solution. Can we talk for 2 minutes?Jim: Ohh, yes. Definitely.Ryan: So, are you currently using any other CRM or Salesmate is the first one you are trying?Jim: We are using ABC at the moment, but a lot of our deals are left unanswered and we miss a lot of business opportunities. We need something to manage our leads in a better way.Ryan: May I know how many members are there in your sales team?Jim: We have 7 sales reps and a team lead. All 8 reach out to the prospects every day.Ryan: I think you have a fairly strong team in terms of numbers. Your problems seem more about the communication gap among sales members, rather than managing the deals.Jim: We use a chat software for our internal use. How can that be a communication problem?Ryan: I think the team members are not aware of the status of deals. They don\u2019t know the progress, they don\u2019t know whether someone has replied to the prospect or not. I think a feature like Team Inbox can be a great solution to your problem.Jim: What exactly does Team Inbox do?Ryan: It\u2019s like a group inbox where every assigned member gets a notification when the prospect replies. Of course, every deal shows you the level of importance. So, any of your teammates can read the previous conversation and respond accordingly. Jus"

            "content": "Revenue is the heart and soul behind the idea of any business\u2019s survival.Having an automated sales funnel allows the business owners to create that sound sales architecture.Businesses that want to survive the tough competition must have a sound sales process that enables them to create a profitable revenue cycle.Let\u2019s ask you a simple question first.Are you aware that the sales funnel includes four crucial stages? No, we are not going to ask you, \u201cwhat\u2019s a Sales Funnel?\u201dIf you are a business owner then you will know that your leads must go through the thinning process to become interested prospects.Sales funnel creates a series of steps.In these steps, the leads get to know about your offering and based on the level of interest they show, are turned into paying customers.Sales funnel generally has three to seven stages.However, we will be explaining the three basic components of the sales funnel here.1. AwarenessAll your potential customers will be starting their customer journey from this part of the funnel.As it is located at the top of your sales funnel, it collects a lot of prospects.At the awareness stage, your audience is getting to know your brand and your company while finding the solution to their problem.Every sales cycle kick starts with the awareness stage.A business must make sure that their solution is recognizable in the market before starting the selling process.Every prospect that is present in the awareness stage of the sales funnel is unqualified.They are unaware of your brand, and the best way to make them aware is by sending out content that is relevant to your offerings.2. Consideration82% of customers viewed five or more pieces of content from the winning vendor before making a purchase (Forrester).Once the audience or your prospects realize that your offering is the best option for solving their problem, they will proceed to the consideration stage.Here, the funnel narrows down a bit to filter the prospects out based on their urgency or intent of purchase.From the customer point-of-view, this is the stage where there are various alternatives available to them, who are providing the same solution to their problems.At this stage, prospects are generally doing their own research by evaluating your solution against the problem they are facing.Free demos clubbed with a limited time offer often helps in converting prospects into paying customers.Demos help prospects in their consideration process as they can get the first-hand experience of how your solution actually works.A limited time offer creates the fear of missing out on a great offer!3. DecisionThe final stage introduces your sales process to your ideal customers who are really interested in making the purchase.The decision stage narrows down to filter the most interesting prospects and sends them into your sales pipeline.Close deals fasterTake control of your sales pipeline with Salesmate CRMTry Salesmate for FreeTraditional sales funnelThe traditional sales funnel typically has these steps.1. LeadsThe online visitors who show interest in your offerings by signing up for newsletters or by filling in their details in your online contact form.2. ProspectingYour leads are considered prospects when they have shown the intent to make the purchase.3. ConversionWhen your online visitors take a specific action like making a purchase.4. Referral CustomerEvery customer who brings other prospects into the funnel is considered as a referral customer.The goal of a sales funnelStill, building a revenue-boosting sales funnel without discovering what your sales funnel\u2019s goal is?Having a sales funnel goal means you are not going in the dark on a mission to make a profit for your business.Ask yourself a simple question, \u201cWhat do I want my prospect to do once they are through my sales funnel?\u201dThe answer to this question might be something like this: \u2018book a demo\u2019, \u2018subscribe to the newsletters\u2019 or \u2018make a purchase\u2019.Business owners need to decide which product or service they would like the lead to buy.So, define the product, and the problem it\u2019s going to solve.Businesses can benefit more if they have a system in place that can evaluate the current data inside the sales process.Before we head towards the next chapter, let\u2019s understand a few more important components of the sales process. Source: McKinseyThe purpose of the marketing department is to reach the customers in those moments where they are open to the idea of accepting or experimenting with the product.Marketing sought these moments or touchpoints where consumers are open to getting influenced.Touchpoints are simply understood through a \u201cfunnel\u201d.Customers start by choosing a number of potential brands in mind.This is the wide end of the funnel as shown above in the image.The marketing team starts implementing their strategies to stay at the top of the consumer\u2019s mind as they methodically reduce the number of brands.The consumers keep moving through the funnel and narrow down to a single bra"

Send personalized emails using sequencesA sales sequence is the second benefit of automation in real estate. You can actually design a series of emails that help you close more deals.The process of sending out a perfect email sequence starts with contact lists. As you know, you have tons of inquiries with specific requirements like locality, area, neighborhood, and Subway availability. People even ask for nearby Starbucks!You can simply enroll all the people with such requirements, and use it to send automated emails.For example; you have many inquiries where buyers are looking for a house with Swimming Pool in Ontario. At the same time, you already know about a dozen properties that have a fancy pool. You can simply add a tag to such contacts with \u201cSwimming Pool\u201d.Using an automated sales sequence, you can send emails to only those people where you can show a dozen properties with a swimming pool. It\u2019s a perfect example of customer targeting.Send automated sales emails that convert!Try Salesmate email sequences.Try Salesmate Now!Once you get a response from any of such leads, you can choose to send further emails manually or make a call right from the system!Sequences are very useful to take follow-ups as well. Let\u2019s say, you suggest various properties to prospects using a series of emails. The first email is a welcome email and the next three shows relevant properties.Sequences let you decide when to hit the follow-up email. So when days pass, but prospects don\u2019t respond; you can send an automated follow-up email.You can simply set up a condition like; Send a follow-up email after 14 days of inactivity.3. Automated workflowsAutomated workflows let you take a certain action when a specific trigger is pressed. All you have to do is design a standardized process and set the right triggers. After each trigger, you have to set up a follow-up action.Let\u2019s understand this with an example:Adam is a real estate agent running a small business with James as his executive. Adam gets so many news leads that he has to create a streamlined process to save him some time for the actual agent tasks like \u2013 open houses or deal closing.This is a workflow he designs:When a new lead enters into the CRM, assign a tag called \u201cNew Lead\u201d.Send an automated welcome email to new leads asking about their preferences with a predefined template.When the prospects respond to his email, he needs James to make a call for a detailed conversation.When James adds a tag of \u201cPremium\u201d to this contact, the task/deal will be assigned to Adam.As a real estate agent, Adam would naturally find more time if such workflow is already set.

Crushing the numbers and making more time for achieving great revenue figures is what sales is all about. You need to be efficient, productive and must drive the moolah to your company! Sales is going through various changes and becoming more buyer-centric. And successful sales prospecting can contribute to revenue generation in a grand manner.The sales cycle mentioned above is an integral part of a sales professional\u2019s life that never changes.You start your first week of the day of every month with the thought of achieving your set quota because that is what generates the revenue.As a sales professional, you must be aware that you and your team members are always racing against the clock to make the quota.However, your hard work will only reap benefits if you have a set of tips, techniques, and tools for successful sales prospecting.This guide is going to assist you in this particular area. Let\u2019s begin with a course refresh!What is sales prospecting?Prospecting is defined as the process where a business search for their potential customers in order to scale their growth in the market.The goal of prospecting is to nurture prospects through the various stages of the sales funnel and convert them into paying customers.Leads vs Prospects: The differenceLeads and prospects often get mixed up in the war of terminologies.LeadsThe potential buyers who express interest in the offering of your business.They are someone who has visited your website or have interacted with certain sections on the website.They might have also subscribed to your blogs or downloaded eBooks from your official website.ProspectsYour leads become prospects when they align with the buyer persona you created for your target audience.A prospect may be classified as a potential customer; however, he is not to be mistaken for a lead.The successful sales prospecting techniques for modern businessesWith the dynamic growth of sales, there is a constant shift in the methodology of prospecting.Sales reps must understand the difference between inbound and outbound sales to derive a better closing ratio.Difference between the two methodologieslet us help you differentiate between the two methodologies.Outbound prospectingCold calls:Unprompted calls made to prospects for the purpose of selling your product or service.Social spams:Unprompted social media messages to prospects for selling your product or service.The Process:Researching leads in this area takes longer as both reps and leads are new to each other.There is not much context for the reps to create a dialogue and move the conversation ahead in a smooth manner.\u00a0Outbound prospecting example:\u201cHi Brian, I am reaching out to you as we\u2019ve worked with similar businesses and they are happy with our solution.\u201dInbound prospectingWarm emails:Email communication that helps explore a relationship with your new prospect who expressed interest in your product or serviceSocial selling:The use of social media for creating a relationship with your prospect.Sales reps can provide value to these leads by answering questions regarding the offerings.\u00a0They can also teach the prospect about your offering by providing the required information.The Process:A comparatively shorter process as the reps have information on the prospects from previous interactions.Easy to get the context of the prospect\u2019s interests and develop a personalized approach.Inbound prospecting example:\u201cHi Dave, the reason I am reaching out is that I noticed you subscribed to our e-book \u2018Improve your sales productivity with these techniques.\u201dPro recommendation: Inbound ProspectingBusinesses must take a balanced and responsible approach to inbound prospecting.\u00a0The reason for our recommendation?\u00a0You must know one fact, not every lead you hunt will be open to the idea of making a purchase from you.The lead you are following up with might be engaged in communication with your competitors itself.\u00a0Or he might have researched about you more thoroughly then you!One more fact to be taken into account is that prospects are 57% through the sales process even before a sales rep makes the first contact.The problem occurs when sales reps contact prospects with the thinking that they are not aware of your business and its offerings.On average, an experienced sales rep may be expected to spend 7.5 hours of cold calling in order to get a single qualified appointment.With the changes happening throughout the sales scenario, the business owners and sales reps must understand the context of the prospects\u2019 needs.And they must start paying attention to the buyers\u2019 online activities.\u00a0If as a business, you start using inbound and outbound prospecting in a responsible manner, you will be well-positioned in front of your buyers.IBM successfully increased its sales by 400% because of a smart inbound prospecting program.\u00a0Run your sales cycle seamlesslyView and keep track of your sales deals "

Hey, I\u2019ve received an email from Ryan. (after a brief pause) the same disappointing sentence again \u201cthe price is too high\u201d(and the enthusiasm drops)Haven\u2019t you too faced something similar in your sales career?No matter which industry you belong to or what you sell.You\u2019ll surely come across the large rock of \u2018negotiation\u2019 that blocks the path to the close.Due to this roadblock, many deals aren\u2019t closed, and several targets remain unachieved.So how to tackle this huge rock of negotiation for winning the sales game?Well, there are many tactics for that. Before I get to the negotiation tactics, let\u2019s first look at some rules and skills that are essential for effective negotiations.Negotiation rules to abideNegotiation is a tricky game. There are certain rules that you should be following for creating a win-win situation.Here are a few rules that you need to follow:1. Be ready to walk awayWhat happens when you try to open a pickle jar and are not able to do it. You try harder, put in efforts and then just ask someone else to do it to save your time. Right?So why waste time on something that\u2019s not worth it. Some prospects purposely use stalling techniques to delay the deal and in the end, refuse. This results in wastage of time. You could have used this time on something more productive.It is necessary to gain a sense of control during negotiation. Often sellers feel that buyers have control and they can get things done their way. This isn\u2019t necessary; it is the seller who gives the power to the buyers by placing themselves in a weaker position.You only lose control when you don\u2019t take control \u2013 Kylie FrancisGain control and walk away if the terms of the deals are not as per your set criteria. However, for this, you need to set your criteria and walk away price before the negotiation starts so that you act at the right time.2. Lead the negotiationBe like the fearless warrior in the battleground and make the first move. Don\u2019t let the other party take control over you. Take charge of the negotiation process and decide how the negotiation will commence, evolve and close.\u201cLeadership is the capacity to translate vision into reality.\u201d Warren BennisDrive the negotiation in the direction you want by taking the lead. I am not asking you to dominate the prospect. But just be on the driver seat and direct the negotiation to an outcome that\u2019s beneficial for both parties.Well, for that, you need to plan and practice. Your confidence and tone matter here.If you hesitate in the beginning, you might not be able to articulate your thoughts clearly. The power might shift to the prospect.There are chances that the prospect might only focus on their benefits. So, while leading the negotiation make sure that the beginning is strong to take control of the entire negotiation process. Sellers who take the lead and make the first offer put themselves in the best position to reach a favorable outcome that\u2019s beneficial for both.3. Effect emotionEmotions play a significant role in negotiation; they are the primary drivers in influencing a buying decision. Why do you think big brands like Nike and L\u2019Or\u00e9al use impactful taglines \u201cJust do it\u201d and \u201cBecause you are worth it\u201d.Potential buyers can connect with such taglines. Nike\u2019s tagline is inspiring, and L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s tagline makes a woman feel good.\u201cPeople don\u2019t buy for logical reasons. They buy for emotional reasons\u201d \u2013 Zig ZiglarSo hit the emotional chord in negotiation.You should be able to inspire your prospect\u2019s emotions but at the same time control your own emotions. You can\u2019t get derailed with your emotions by getting too anxious or appearing frustrated.Be calm during the negotiation. With the right mindset, you can drive the negotiation to a positive outcome that\u2019s mutually beneficial for both.Evoke different emotions in your prospect.Like for instance \u201cSadness\u201d \u2013 Revolve around their problem area. For this, you\u2019ll have to find out their needs, concerns, and challenges in the initial phase of the sales process. They might be upset or dissatisfied for not reaching their goals due to some roadblock that\u2019s holding them back. Gathering such information will help in negotiations. You can target the area where they are struggling and show them how your solution will help in overcoming a specific problem.In this way, you can target this and various other emotions like fear, greed, etc. to win the negotiation game.Manage your sales seamlesslyView and keep track of your sales deals with Salesmate CRMTry Salesmate for FreeSales negotiation skillsSales negotiation can be simple or complex.

They should feel it\u2019s the best option they have to resolve their ongoing issues. You just need to play with the words smartly.Look at the below \u2018find your place\u2019 ad campaign that StreetEasy created for their New York real estate mobile app.Here they have focused on their target audience\u2019s problem and preference to draw their potential buyers towards the app.They highlighted the section in a relatable way and used apt content.

After an in-depth study about this subject, Dr. Robert Ciadini came up with six principles of persuasion. The right use of these six principles can help in selling a product swiftly.Here are Cialdini\u2019s six principles of persuasion that can help in selling:ReciprocityScarcityAuthorityConsistencyLikingConsensusCialdini principle of persuasion no. 1 \u2013 ReciprocityPress the rewind button of your life and recollect the times when someone went out of their way to do something for you.Didn\u2019t you feel like doing something in return?This same feeling should be evoked in your prospects.This is called reciprocity. It plays a great role in persuading potential prospects. This principle of persuasion states that humans have the tendency of treating others the way they\u2019ve been treated. Here you respond to a positive action with another positive action.\u2018You scratch my back and I\u2019ll scratch yours\u2019. \ud83d\ude09When you do something for the prospect, they see it as a nice gesture and try to do something in return. This something can be anything from a sale to a referral or anything that you value.Life is a reciprocal exchange. To move forward, you have to give back. \u2013 Oprah WinfreyReciprocity in actionIn sales the more you give to the prospects and help them, the happier they get. This happiness helps you in making more sales. This is how the law of reciprocity helps in persuading the prospects.Example:An organic textile manufacturer contacted a B2B company that connects manufacturers with potential buyers.The manufacturer subscribed to their premium membership that included contacts of 30 buyers from their preferred city and a free microsite on the B2B company\u2019s website.Later, the B2B company even featured the manufacturer\u2019s organic product in their special sustainability magazine. This helped the manufacturer in promoting its product.Through its kind gesture, the B2B company got into the good books of the manufacture. The manufacturer didn\u2019t only approach the B2B company again for selling their yarn but also referred the portal to few in their network.Key takeaway:Wa"

Salespeople, be it in B2B or B2C, can easily relate to it.Although sales usually mean the efforts to sell something, there is a substantial difference in how B2B sales and B2C works.\u201cB2B eCommerce will drive $1.8 Trillian in revenue by 2023.\u201d \u2013 ForresterIn this article, we\u2019ll talk about interesting statistics like that and everything about B2B sales that you should know. Let\u2019s start with the basics.Jump to your favorite section:1. What is B2B Sales?2. B2B sales process3. The difference between B2B sales and B2C sales.4. The evolution of B2B Sales5. Modern B2B sales tips6. B2B sales scripts examples (emails, calls, and meetings)What is B2B sales?When a business sells something to another business, whether a service or a product, it falls under B2B sales. Every business, one way or another, depends on another business to create their products.Business to business sales can be seen in various ways. For example; a business processing sugar can provide its product to a business that is making soda.In Information and Technology industry, a business that offers an HR solution can provide its software to an agency that needs to manage its employee database.We can also see B2B models where a business produces/offers products or services for another business. For example, an American potato chips making company rely on a local business for the production and use their own brand name to market the product.The point is, two businesses can get involved in a lot of ways, and when that turns into financial terms, we call it B2B sales.How does the B2B sales cycle look like?Here\u2019s the simple process of how B2B sales work. To understand the concept of B2B sales, we have to go through these 5 five steps:1. Prospecting2. Initiate contact3. Identify needs4. Present offer5. Close deals1. ProspectingProspecting is all about finding the right potential B2B buyers that can use your products or services. For example, if you\u2019re running KPO, your goal is to find the companies that can outsource their information-related business activities to your business.In prospecting, you identify the kinds of businesses that are the right customers for you. And for that, you must know your buyer persona. Now, a business can have multiple buyer personas, so you have to be very careful while drafting them.To properly identify your buyer persona, you have to keep the following things in mind:\nIndustryAnnual turnoverTheir clienteleDemographicsHistory of their businessBrand valueObjectivesProblems they\u2019re facingSolutions you can offerUsing these pointers, you can identify if your offerings match with their needs or not. When the marketing team forwards a bunch of leads to the sales department, they filter the leads based on buyer personas.2. Initiate contactOnce your leads match your buyer persona, it\u2019s time to initiate contact with them. Now, there are tons of ways to start connecting with your prospects. But the most common, and successful ways are calls, emails, and meetings.You find the contact information of these prospects and reach out to them using various channels. This process has no time limits; it can take minutes to months to reach your prospects.But once you do reach out to them, your goal is to have a productive discussion on what exactly they are looking for and how you can help them with your services.3. Identify needsIn this stage, you\u2019re in conversation with your prospect. This is the point where you\u2019ll ask questions that can help you identify what exactly they\u2019re looking for.Why is it important?Because then you can identify if your business can provide what they\u2019re looking for. Valuable questions like these would help:\nWhat kind of problems is your business facing lately?Why is your current solution disappointing?What kind of solution are you looking for?How much are you willing to spend on such a solution?4. Present offerBased on the problems the business is facing, you have to identify if your solution is right for their business or not. After successfully identifying that, you\u2019ll have to present your offer.Now, there are two possibilities, either they will negotiate, or they will simply agree to what you\u2019re offering.Negotiation is a big part of any sales, so you may have to stretch it to a place where both the businesses are comfortable in joining hands.5. Close dealsOnce both parties agree, you\u2019ll be closing the deal. That\u2019s the point where you\u2019ll start providing your solution, and your business gets a paying customer.Run your sales cycle seamlessly!View and keep track of your sales deals with Salesmate CRMTry Salesmate for FreeThe difference between B2B sales and B2C salesNow that we have understood how B2B sales work, it\u2019s time to identify the main differences between B2B and B2C sales.

            "content": "I know in this fast-paced business world, it is difficult even to spare a few minutes. So, let\u2019s just skip the general intro and look at a common scenario that you might have probably faced in your sales career.Scenario:You had a great two minutes conversation with a prospect. He agrees to meet you but needs a little time to check his schedule for giving a convenient time.You agree to wait.The hours turn into days, but you don\u2019t hear from the potential prospect.After a long wait, you decide to follow-up.But still, don\u2019t receive any response.Some important task comes up and you eventually forget about the deal.In this way, you might have abandoned many other deals and missed several lucrative opportunities.50% of sales happen after 5 follow-ups. But sadly, the average sales reps make only 2 attempts to reach a prospect.Yes, as a busy sales rep with big targets, it might get difficult to keep track of a deal and continuously follow-up.But there is always a way to get your work done.For instance, in this situation, you can take the help of sequences and put your follow-up on autopilot. You can either create email sequences or text sequences by adding a few stages and get them executed at different time intervals. For the best results, you can merge both email and text in a single sequence.How?Well, I\u2019ll get to that. But first, let\u2019s look at email sequences and text sequences individually.Email sequencesAn email sequence is a series of emails sent at predetermined intervals. It is the best way of getting rid of the hassle of remembering to send continuous follow-up emails. It helps you in engaging and moving a prospect ahead in the sales journey. The emails can be conveniently executed at the time when the prospects are actively checking their inboxes.You can add multiple steps in a single sequence and send as many emails as you like to follow-up with a potential prospect.The prospect might not reply to the first email. They might even miss out on the second, but if your follow-up email is compelling, there are chances you might get a response to the third email.You can create email sequences for different scenarios like for following up with the prospect post-meeting or after sending a proposal. Besides, automated email sequences are timesaving; through simple automation, you can follow-up seamlessly without any extra work.Text sequencesText sequences aren\u2019t much different from email sequences. Here you use to the medium of text messages in a series for following-up with your prospects.Text sequences is a convenient route to reach potential buyers. Being short, with limited characters, text messages have high chances of getting noticed.90% of text messages are read within 3 minutesWhether you want to remind customers about the upcoming meeting or request for important details, you can do it easily with the help of text sequences. It is a simple yet effective way to capture the attention of potential buyers and prompt them to respond. However, for that, you need to ensure that your message isn\u2019t too long. It should be short and precise.As per research, text results to over 200% more responses and almost 300% higher \u201cyes\u201d responses compared to phone calls.Manage your sales seamlesslyView and keep track of your sales deals with Salesmate CRMTry Salesmate for FreeHow does the magic happen?Simply create a sequence of emails/texts (Either draft new content or use predefined templates)Set time intervals between the stagesEnroll single or bulk contactsSet specific criteria for executing the emails/texts at the preferred timeEither let the sequences be executed automatically or step in and control the executionCombining the two effective channels in a single sequenceNo doubt, moving a lead forward in the sales process isn\u2019t an easy task. Most of the follow-up activities fail to get a response from the prospect. Which is why you need to explore every channel and do all that it takes to drive action.We all know that both texts and emails are very powerful channels with excellent capabilities.Have you ever thought of merging these two powerful channels?They can prove to be lucrative together.Merge them in a sequence and explore their capabilities together.Let me show you how.Do you remember the above scenario where the prospect vanished suddenly without giving a convenient time for scheduling the meeting?So here in that scenario, you could have made the prospect respond by following up through both email and text (SMS).You could have easily created a single sequence with a few stages as emails and others as text.Below is an example of that. (I have created a short sequence. You can add more stages if required)Stage one \u2013 First follow-up emailHey Clara,I was awaiting your response.I assume as you have too much on your plate, you might have forgotten about the meeting we were supposed to schedule.Request you to share your convenient time for scheduling the meeting so that we could proceed further?Looking forward to your res"

Your end goal can be anything like;1. Converting free customers into paying.2. Increase the audience of your articles.3. Improve the traffic to your site.4. Get more subscribers to your channel or blog.5. Inviting them for an event.6. Increase the reach of your brand a.k.a. Branding.\u00a0These are the types of email sequences that we\u2019re going to understand in this article:Onboarding email sequenceNewsletter or training sequenceCold email sequenceAbandon cart recovery sequenceAccount renewal sequenceWebinar (event sequence)Conversion sequenceLet\u2019s start.What is the difference between a drip sequence and an email sequence?We have mentioned 7 kinds of sequences above. Just to clear the air, we have to understand the major difference between a drip sequence and an email sequence. They both have a series of emails lined up, but this is the main difference:In a normal email sequence, the contacts will no longer receive emails once they take some kind of action. For example, I\u2019m sending out abandoned cart recovery emails to my thousand customers. Customers who cleared their cart or made a purchase will be removed from the further sequence.On the other hand, in drip sequence, the customers or prospects will constantly get emails as per the intervals decided. The finest example of a drip sequence is \u2013 Onboarding sequence.\u00a0Can we start our examples with an onboarding sequence?1. Onboarding email sequenceOnboarding is the process of introducing your product or service with the prospects. Basically, it\u2019s a walk-through for your prospects or new customers. This drip sequence helps customers understand your product/service better.

Newsletter or training sequenceThe second best example of a drip sequence is a newsletter or training sequence. Here, you send out a series of emails to educate your readers.\u00a0There are no conversion goals from such a sequence, but the real achievement is branding. People will really start to connect and understand your brand. They will regularly visit your blog to read articles.

            "content": "Email drip campaign has been helping businesses get their brand message across to the prospects for a very long time.And, emails have continuously dominated the sales legacy, even after the rise of social media, phone calls, and text messages.Yet, emailing 100 contacts in a day might sound like a mounting task to many sales professionals.Email campaigns are often long and repetitive in nature.Email sequences bring in automation to the mix and make the life of every sales professional easier.Salesmate CRM has been dedicated to solving the problems associated with manual labor that is part and parcel of your daily sales activities.One such sales activity is the sending of outreach emails to prospects. It is a time-consuming and tedious work process and requires the utmost attention of the sales professionals.Sometimes it eats into their actual selling time and often makes them miss out on following up with revenue critical prospects.Many sales professionals have revealed that data entry takes up 17% of their selling timeToday, we are sharing how a CRM with sequences (Salesmate) will provide sales professionals and business owners with a platform that automates their email drip campaigns.But, before diving further into the topic, let\u2019s get some brief idea about sequences.What are email sequences?A series of emails are sent out to a group of contacts based on pre-set time intervals, trigger-based automation or both.Time-based email sequences involve messages sent out at predetermined intervals.\u00a0For e.g. You want to send an email to your prospect immediately after they subscribe to your service, 10 days after making their purchase, 20 days later, 30 days later, etc.\u00a0For instance.Your sales professionals have been attending various events over the past few weekends. They now have a new batch of fresh leads that they must reach out to.Normally, they will be using the excel sheets to filter out these contacts into calling and emailing lists.Now they will start reaching out to them over the chosen mode of communication one by one.Let\u2019s be completely honest with each other here, we know many contacts won\u2019t respond back immediately. So, your new task will be to remember a follow-up with those contacts over the next few days and weeks.They might automate the process of reminding the task of sending out follow-up emails but the need for writing individual emails still is unproductive, based on the number of contacts.This is where sequences come in and enhance your sales productivity.\u00a0Just write your sequence of emails once and all prospects that you enroll in your drip will automatically receive your thoughtfully written outreach emails.With Salesmate\u2019s sequences, your sales force can become more effective in their overall activities and contribute toward generating revenue.Why businesses must create email sequences?Because of automation and the ease of focussing on the other necessary sales tasks. When businesses learn how to use both timed and trigger-based emails, they can convert more prospects.For instance.You are an e-commerce website owner. You have set up an abandonment cart sequence. When an online shopper adds a product to their cart but cancels the purchase, a triggered email follow up series will begin to make the customer come back to the cart and complete the purchase.In simple terms, an email sequence is a series of pre-written follow-up emails that automatically get sent to prospects over the course of days or weeks.A time-based email sequence involves messages sent out at predetermined intervals. These emails are also called \u2018autoresponders\u2019.Trigger-based email sequences are sent when certain actions get taken on your website or within your email sequence.How to create an email sequence inside Salesmate CRM?Creating email sequences is easy. Simply select your contacts, pick the templates, add as many stages as you like and choose the delay.When you\u2019re ready to add contacts to a sequence, you can do so individually or bulk-enroll them.\u00a0Sequences are the best vessel for taking prospects onto a journey of becoming your paying customers and even an advocate of your brand.Every business can benefit from using sales email sequences.What is a drip campaign?Drip marketing is a communication strategy that sends, or \u201cdrips,\u201d a pre-written set of messages to customers or prospects over time. These messages often take the form of email marketing, although other media can also be used. Drip marketing is distinct from other database marketing in two ways: the timing of the messages follow a predetermined course; the messages are dripped in a series applicable to a specific behavior or status of the recipient. It is also typically automated. WikipediaEmail campaigns are a sequence of marketing efforts that share relevant content to your contacts at once via emails.Event emails and onboarding emails sequence are examples of drip campaigns.Drip campaigns can be easy as well as complex based on the nature of your busines"

For example;Press 1 for SalesPress 2 for MarketingPress 3 for SupportAlthough, IVR is not a compulsion for every business. Many businesses have direct lines, and customers can be directed to voicemail. But a few seconds of greetings before voicemail can be really helpful to your business. Professional voicemail greetings can be used for cross-selling your products and services and also divert your customers to your app and website.Here are some of the benefits of creating a business voicemail greeting:1. Leave a great impression on your customers.2. Tell them the reason for your unavailability.3. Redirect them to your website or online store or app.4. Promote offers and discount details to improve sales.5. Upsell or cross-sell your products/services.6. Announce an event or company news.Quality considerations for your professional voicemail greetingConsider these points while creating your business voicemail script:\nEvery single call is a lead for you, so either there\u2019s an opportunity to leave a great impression or an opportunity to sell something.Your business voicemail greeting should pass on the right message.\u00a0Be apologetic about not receiving the customer call.Voicemails create a visual image of your business in the customer\u2019s mind, so you will need to put a message that represents your business in the best way possible.\u00a0You don\u2019t want your customers to be greeted by a robotic and monotonous voice that seems it is dragging the message. Instead, deliver it in a warm and personalized manner.\u00a0While setting your business voicemail greeting, give the right amount of consideration to the language and tone.Be considerate. By considerate, we mean to consider the profile of the person who will be listening to the voicemail message.\u00a0Tailor the voicemail greeting precisely, so that it is not too straightforward or not too less informative while conveying your message.You have to identify your customer base very carefully. For example; if your clientele comes from young startups, having a casual tone will not be such a bad idea. If they are Wall Street executives, a formal tone will make a better impact on them.\u00a0Always be friendly and courteous while you are delivering your voicemail greeting message to the callers via your business voicemail greeting.Keep your business voicemail greetings up-to-date\nOnce you have a voicemail greeting script that is up to your company standards, get it recorded.\u00a0Now test your business voicemail greetings. Allow your co-workers, peers, and friends to make calls to your support numbers and ask for their feedback on the tone and impact of your voicemails.\u00a0The most honest message comes from your customer base because they can guide you to the most crucial point they would like to listen to while greeted by your opening message. If they give you feedback, accept it gracefully.Every significant change you bring to your business, change your professional voicemail greeting to share the information.Keep your voicemail greeting short and simple\nA very critical point that we would like you to learn is that even though your voicemails greetings are meant to be informative, clear and to-the-point, do not exceed the general time limit and try to keep it as short as possible.\u00a0The attention span of your callers is small. Many of the customers may cut the call as soon as they reach your voicemail greeting.\u00a0So, don\u2019t waste their time and target a maximum of 10 seconds time for your professional voicemail greeting.Make sure your voicemail greeting is audible\nYour voicemail must be recorded by someone whose baritone matches yo"

Don\u2019t email \u201cangry\u201dWriting an email when you are infuriated is a big no-no.Don\u2019t pour your already seething anger in an email. You will end up typing things that may have a serious repercussion.You might lose a lucrative deal. Prospects don\u2019t take time in switching to other vendors if they have an unpleasant experience.\u201cIf you don\u2019t take care of your customers, then your competition will. Don\u2019t give them that opportunity\u201d \u2013 Shep HykenTake a deep breath; calm yourself before typing an email. Or maybe choose another day for sending that email. Whenever emotions come into play, it\u2019s better to take a little time rather than making things more complicated. Send the email when you are in the right frame of mind.2. Keep it shortDo you know how you can save more hours for selling? By eliminating unnecessary things like \u2013 \u201cwriting lengthy sales emails.\u201dWhat\u2019s the point in writing long tales that prospects won\u2019t even read? No one is interested in wasting their valuable time in wading through those convoluted sentences.Therefore \u2013Be precise.Only include the necessary points.Limit the number of words you use in the email.A study by Boomerang found that sales emails between 50 to 125 words get better response rate.Try not to exceed five or six sentences while writing sales emails.

            "title": "How contact management software evolved into a CRM",
            "content": "In 1933, when Edwin Armstrong invented FM technology, nobody knew it would exist as one of the features of mobile phones. Just like that, many important innovations have become a part of something more significant to help people in a better way. Evolution is necessary; let\u2019s agree with Darwin.In this article, we\u2019re talking about one such example.How contact management evolved into customer relationship management (CRM)This image shows the evolution of contact management software briefly, have a look:In simple words, contact management is a system where all the customer data is stored, and users can find every detail from a single place. Initially, contact management software used to gather basics like email address, phone number, notes, etc.But soon, businesses felt the need for much more and wanted to get a 360\u00b0 customer view. So, now a contact management system can gather more information like recent activities with clients, email conversations, shared files, messages, call logs, etc.The 1980s was the time when businesses had a lot of information to sell products. In the 1990s, businesses started exploring more ways to use that information to drive more sales by Sales Force Automation. SFA helped businesses in streamlining some daily tasks like updating records, assigning tasks, taking follow-ups, sending emails, etc. Sales Force Automation saves significant time so that businesses can utilize it in more productive ways. 1995 \u2013 Businesses were reaching new heights, hence the need for advanced features was also rising. Customer Relationship Management (CRM) was introduced that can help businesses keep track of customers and take important steps to increase sales. Soon, the development of CRM tool grew, and now we have many advanced features in a single suite. Features like visual sales pipeline, sales goal tracking, bulk emailing, email tracking, shared team inbox, built-in calling, and many more. \u00a0\u00a0Now, all the major CRMs are available on SaaS and mobile to offer flexibility.Why this evolution?Any evolution takes place because the system demands certain changes. Humans evolved from apes because our surrounding was asking for the change. The same way, contact management system wasn\u2019t enough for modern businesses, hence the slow birth of customer relationship management software. Back in the 1980s, businesses were more concerned about managing the details of customers, so they can connect with them and sell their products. In the late 1990s, business preferences were changed, and the systems were more focused on how to build a deeper relationship with customers to sell and upsell products. Contact management software was not enough for businesses, but still important as a feature.One more important reason for this evolution is \u2013 Team Collaboration. Back in the 80s, customer details were used by sales teams to make cold calls and pitch products. Now, the picture is prettier.Marketing and sales teams are collaborating and finding more ways to pitch products to the right prospects, at the right time, so sales are assured. We can safely say this evolution has changed the equation from \u201cSales\u201d to \u201cMarketing + Sales\u201d and that\u2019s how the contact management became one of the features of a CRM.Why use contact management in CRM?91% of the businesses with more than 11 employees use CRM software.The use of CRM is increasing every single day for various reasons. In this segment, we\u2019re talking about why businesses are using CRM for contact management, and why you should too.1. Everything at onceYou can manage every detail of your customer at a single place, so you can find it whenever you need it. Starting from contact information to deal status, you can fetch the entire history of a particular customer with your business. 2. The timelineFrom the moment you create a contact till right now, you can check every small progress of customers with your company. The timeline can give you great insights on points of selling & upselling. You can predict when exactly you can pitch products/services to customers. The timeline also helps in activity management, email tracking, and many more. 3. Activity managementWith contact management in CRM, you can create new activities, set up reminders, add new deals, add notes, attach files, and check past activities. Managing activities inside a CRM keeps you informed about your previous conversations with customers, and help you take the right decisions in the future. 4. IntegrationsIntegrations make things easier! One of the major benefits of using contact management in CRM is Integrations. CRMs are capable of integrating with third-party apps like Slack, ClearBit, Google Drive, etc. You can fetch data from these apps and create contacts directly in your current CRM.5.

            "title": "Building a customer service team that is also a sales team",
            "content": "The value of great customer service in generating additional sales cannot be overstated.62% of B2B and 42% of B2C customers buy more from a business after a positive customer service experience.Directly and indirectly, your customer service team has a major impact on your sales.Every business can reap the rewards of integrating customer service into their sales strategy. Here are 10 ways to build a customer service team that is also a sales team.1. Problem-solvers, not product-sellersCustomers keep their guard up when talking to sales reps \u2013 they know you are trying to make a sale.Conversely, they will usually see your customer service agents as problem-solvers.Brian Tracy describes the most effective sales method is to \u201capproach each customer with the idea of helping him or her solve a problem or achieve a goal, not of selling a product or service.\u201dThis puts your customer support team in a uniquely strong position to make a sale, as they are already there primarily to solve your customer\u2019s problems.When your sales team recommends a product, the customer assumes they are trying to get a sale. When your customer service team recommends a product, the customer assumes they are trying to solve the problem.Make sure your customer service training included understanding who your customers are and the problems your products solve for them.This will enable your customer service teams to recommend products to solve a customer\u2019s problem.2. Upselling as problem-solvingTrain your customer service team to problem-solve by upselling.A strong understanding of which products and services complement each other is an integral part of this.Customers may trust a customer service agent\u2019s recommendation more than sales reps.\u00a0Customers expect the sales team to sell, and the customer service team to solve their problems. You know it\u2019s more complicated than that, but this is how many customers look at it.These expectations allows your customer service team to make recommendations that a customer may dismiss from a sales representative.Your customer service team can support your sales team by taking transfers during a sales call.Some customers want reassurance about the product by speaking to a \u2018non-salesperson\u2019.3. Customer and product knowledgeIt can frustrate to contact businesses for information only to discover that the agent knows less than you do.Your teams need as much training on service and policy changes as they do on the products themselves.Make sure your customer service teams understand changes and the reasoning behind them.Customers can lose faith in your organization from a single agent who wasn\u2019t up to speed.4. Personalized ServiceKnowledge about your customers is just as important as knowing about your products.Keep detailed notes in your CRM about every interaction any department has with a customer. Having instant access to such a knowledge base can help in establishing and maintaining healthy customer relationships.\u00a0The more your customer service team knows about a customer, the better they can tailor their approach to that customer. Even simple info like how a customer wants you to address them can make a big difference.Enabling your customer support agents to provide a personalized service in this way makes customers feel you care about them.Keeping an existing customer can be 5 times cheaper than attracting a new customer.\u201cIt never ceases to amaze me that companies spend millions to attract new customers (people they don\u2019t know) and spend next to nothing to keep the ones they\u2019ve got! Seems to me the budgets should be reversed!\u201d \u2013Tom PetersSpending some extra time to showing your customers matter is a smart investment.As much as we like to think we do business for logical reasons, often it comes down to how we feel about a business.When a business remembers us and treats us as individuals, we view that business in a positive light.In the words of Ben & Jerry\u2019s Co-Founder Ben Cohen:\u201cThere is a spiritual aspect to our lives \u2014 when we give, we receive \u2014 when a business does something good for somebody, that somebody feels good about them!\u201dKeeping detailed notes in your CRM is a simple and powerful method of achieving this.5. Issue and Query Tracking67% of customers attribute a negative customer service experience to having to repeat their problem multiple times.This sends a clear message that your business is not treating their situation as a high priority.Discourage the use of canned responses to a customer or potential customer inquiry.Personalising message templates for each customer is a small job that can make a big difference to how a customer feels.6. Customer service promotes your businessThe quality of your customer service is a selling point.Poor quality customer service is a major concern for many customers and more than half of consumers will pay more just for a better customer service experience.\u201cAlways keep in mind the old retail adage: Customers remember the service a lot longer than they remember "

            "content": "Many business owners have made a fortune whilst following what they call \u2018gut-feeling\u2019 or intuition. Industry experts argue that making million-dollar deals, based on some mystical source is not logical at all. The explanation for intuition or gut-feeling is simple, it\u2019s the ability of a business owner to match, assess and work on a current scenario by recalling a similar event in their past, subconsciously. However, to take a massive advantage of your intuition, you need to have a past experience.In this article, we will be covering a few ways business intelligence helps businesses grow. The digitized age of business tools has enabled users to take the help of technology and use it for their immense growth. Business intelligence allows small, medium and large enterprises to use the power of big data by analyzing the same and come up with trends and solutions.What is business intelligence?Business Intelligence (BI) is a combination of tools, technologies, applications, and practices that help businesses in collecting, integrating, analyzing, and presenting raw data into insightful and actionable business information. BI is made up ofData miningAnalytical processingQuerying and reportingWhat is the purpose of business intelligence?The major purpose that Business Intelligence serves for a business is helping the corporate executives, business managers, and other operational heads take better data-driven business decisions. Many companies are using BI for cost-cutting, identifying better business opportunities, and spotting inefficient business processes.What are the benefits of using business intelligence?The major benefits that business intelligence provides are directly derived from the purpose it serves in the modern business scenario. Business intelligence helps in:Accelerating decision-making processOptimizing internal business processesIncreasing the operational efficiencyDriving revenuesGaining competitive advantagesIdentifying the market trendsSpotting addressable business problemsThe major issue in the modern business scenario is that business owners often mix business analytics with business intelligence. A business owner must understand that the core of BI is reporting not process management. Business intelligence has the power of transforming organizations; however, this is not implemented because business owners lack the knowledge ofWhat BI involves?Where should they start?How long does the result take to show?Let\u2019s explore the bits and pieces of business intelligence and guide you towards the path that will help you transform your business process; making you successful.1. Smarter decision-making processBeing a business owner or at the managerial level having a firm grip on your organizational data is important. Information doesn\u2019t generally mean intelligence especially it is scattered all around the organization.The sole purpose if business intelligence is to get your organizational information structured and analyzable. Business intelligence enables businesses in strategic decision-making. Having a system in place that keeps your organizational at a centralized location and up-to-date, leads to better business decisions and superior financial performance.A smart sales CRM (Customer Relationship Management) solution plays a pivotal role as it bridges the gap between managers and subordinates. The gap is bridged as the system delivers a range of key business metrics such asProductivityTeam performanceCustomer product/service preferencesSales cyclesCustomer purchase behaviorCore customersRevenues andMarket trendsAll these metrics have their own sets of data that are compiled inside sales CRM. The CRM then uses its reporting feature for analyzing this bulk data. Once the analysis is done by the CRM system it provides the data in the form of facts and figures which the upper management of a company uses to pinpoint any discrepancies. In short, the business owner, rather than going for the intuition, backs his decision with hard facts that the CRM reports to him.2. Improved customer service\u201cPeople will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel\u201d \u2013 Maya AngelouIt\u2019s all about providing world class customer experience to your customer base.

            "content": "There is an underlying confusion regarding the importance of follow-up emails in the industry. Are they intrusive? Will the consumer even bother to open them, or will it fill the bin?Well, here\u2019s a stat to calm your fears: 70% of all unanswered sales related email chains are the ones that were not followed up with a second email. (Source \u2013 yesware.com)Consumers are targeted on a daily basis with automated advertisement emails and spam-filled links (8.6 billion emails are sent out, each day!).\u00a0 Which is why they cannot be blamed for ignoring yet another marketing email.However, this is exactly why marketers should follow up with potential clients. A second email lets the consumer know that the first email wasn\u2019t an automated bot message, but one specifically crafted for them.New Ideas For Follow Up EmailsGeneric follow-up emails are as good as the ones that weren\u2019t sent. There is a need to be quick, straightforward, and human, if you are to succeed at converting a potential lead.In the next paragraphs, we\u2019ll explore multiple ideas that ensure that the follow-up emails end up converting consumers that failed to convert with your initial email outreach. Let\u2019s get started:Customization Is KeyGeneric emails not only fail to yield a respectable response rate, but they also come across as a lazy effort to fool the recipient into replying.Customization not only signals work you\u2019ve invested in crafting an email specifically for the client, but also resonates greatly with their needs, which is more likely to elicit a response.For instance, you market a workflow automation application that is aimed to streamline work processes. Despite the application being useful for a marketing professional, a boiler template aimed at a professional who receives dozens of marketing emails a day is bound to find its way to the bin.Conversely, if what you are offering can be molded to help the consumer solve their problems, such as explaining how they can use it to create automated triggers for emails that are yet to be responded to, you increase your chances of getting a reply back manifold.After all, email customization and personalization increases click-through and conversion rates by more than 10% respectively.Keep It Short And SimpleWhile email marketing as a whole should adhere to shorter text lengths (lengthy emails don\u2019t appeal to the consumers), follow-up emails should particularly live by the KISS (keep it short and simple) rule.However, this doesn\u2019t translate to doing away with the small talk required to initiate a conversation. Marketers should make it a point to respect the time of the consumer by doing away with the details embedded in the initial outreach, and coming directly to the point of the email \u2013 that is following up on the previous conversation.Be Creative With Your Subject LineAs the first piece of content that distinguishes your email from all others, subject lines determine whether your email is going to be opened or not.This is more important in the case of follow-up emails, as they are following up on the previous outreach effort, and must pertain to the situation and consequence of the initial email.For instance, if you\u2019re following up from a call or meeting that you had with the client, the subject line should read something like: \u2018Next Step.\u2019 By incorporating this subject line in their follow-up methods a company benefited with an increased open rate of 70.5%, and a reply rate of 49.6%.In case the initial email failed to materialize a conversation, an email subject line like \u2018I forgot to mention\u2026\u2019 is likely to perform better than its predecessor. By adding a human element to the email, it depicts a natural (and non-salesy) side, while subconsciously paving the way for you to present more benefits the consumer can derive from the product.Subtle Humor Is Always WelcomeMarketing involves playing with the psychology of the masses, so why not introduce it in your follow up emails?However, there is a fine line between being funny and unprofessional. Don\u2019t subject your potential customers to unprofessional humor, or ask them to select options that you have specified in your email as that comes across as gimmicky.If you\u2019re unsure about how to walk the fine line, it pays to stick to a professional email.Adding Context Can Work Wonders You can add flair and humor to your subject line to entice the consumer, but there needs to be something in your follow up email that distinguishes you from the average marketer trying to reach the monthly goal.Give your emails context to weigh it down with additional value. There are many ways to add context and value, such as:\nAny interaction in the past, be it a social network chat or a blog comment.\nAny mutual connection, or common points.\nIf you lack such \u2018connectors,\u2019 it pays to take a look at your customer\u2019s social media accounts to gauge how to approach this person.Adding context can bear fruits for your outreach efforts like it did for Jason Zook.

The modern B2B buyers know what they want, they\u2019ve set their buying parameters.Moreover, they are surrounded by a wide range of options. Which means you don\u2019t only have to handle smart buyers but also deal with fierce competition. Buyers receive more than ten sales presentations in a day. Your competitors are constantly targeting them.To succeed in the B2B sales battleground, you don\u2019t only need to exceed the expectations of the buyers but also step ahead of the competitors by embracing innovation.\u201cYou can\u2019t look at the competition and say you\u2019re going to do it better. You need to look at the competition and say you\u2019re going to do it differently\u201d \u2013 Steve JobsDecoding B2B salesB2B sales is the widely used abbreviation for business-to-business sales. \u00a0A selling model where one business sells its products or services to another business. Unlike B2C sales, B2B sales have a longer buying cycle, higher price point and more hurdles for closing a deal. Here you are dealing with experienced decision-makers who are looking for the best deals and excellent product to multiply their profits.B2B sales is becoming incredibly complex. You need to plan and stay prepared for winning in this highly complex and competitive environment. Understanding the B2B buyers as well as having the right strategies and b2b sales tools is imperative for climbing the stairs of success.Adapting to the modern B2B buyersWith more information easily available, customers are taking the smarter route to purchase a product. For increasing your B2B sales, you need to understand how the customers are making purchases. B2B buyers aren\u2019t ready to settle for anything. Over the last few years, there has been a massive change in the buyer\u2019s behavior.1. The expectations are risingB2B buyers want everything but at cost-effective price. Their demands are surging at a great pace. They are looking for a more customized yet easy to use solution at a great price. Competitors are low balling their prices to attract such customers.Yes, you must meet the expectations of your potential customers, but you don\u2019t need to join the crowd and lower your price like others.\nTry to offer more benefits to these customers.\nFocus on value.\nFind out what your customers want and try to meet as well as exceed their expectations.B2B buyers don\u2019t mind paying if they get value for their money. 52% buyers said they would pay more for speedy and efficient customer experience.\u201cCustomer experience is the next competitive battleground\u201d \u2013 Jerry Gregoire 2. Buyers want to see proofMost of the sellers do not deliver what they promise during the B2B sales process. Initially, companies claim that their products can do a lot of things, but later they disappoint the buyers. This is the reason why most of the buyers do not trust the B2B sellers. They expect to see proof.In modern B2B sales, it is necessary to gain the trust and confidence of the buyers. Ensure them you are not like those companies who just make big promises.\nGive them proof of the value you provide.\nShow them facts and statistics.\nGive them demos.Let them use your product and see for themselves what your product can do. Make the customers feel more comfortable about doing business with you.3. Buyers intent to speak to the specialistHaving a high level of product knowledge is essential for winning in this competitive landscape. Some sellers are either nervous or not prepared.They memorize the major points of few features just to sell the product. They aren\u2019t interested in understanding or helping the buyers. So, when buyers question such sellers out of the blue, they either go blank or just beat around the bush.Buyers want to interact with experts who know everything about their field and the product they sell. Such specialists can help them in their buying process.\nGive your sales reps proper training about the product\nAsk them to use to product for seeing how it works\nCreate a sales playbook and encourage your sales team to use itMake a good impression on your buyers by guiding them on the right route and give them reasons to move ahead in the B2B sales process.4.

(source)That\u2019s too much for a day, isn\u2019t it? Most of the times important emails don\u2019t get necessary attention in such cluttered inboxes. Unanswered emails and internal conflicts within the team often result in a loss.Real-time response, effective communication, successful team collaboration, and efficient email management is imperative for increasing sales conversion as well as customer retention. Most of the companies understand this and so have implemented shared inbox to facilitate team collaboration, enhance productivity and improve their overall results.Shared team inbox \u2013 The basicShared inbox is a streamlined platform to manage internal as well as external communications efficiently. There is no single owner of such inboxes; multiple users can access and manage it together. Shared inbox minimizes inefficiencies and helps teams in staying organized. A wide spectrum of coordinated activities can be performed together using a collaborative inbox.Teams can send and receive emails from a common address like queries@xyz.com, sales@xyz.com, contact@xyz.com, info@xyz.com.They can easily share the responsibility of responding to the emails and offer timely assistance to the clients.\u201cUnity is strength. When there is teamwork and collaboration, wonderful things can be achieved\u201d \u2013 Mattie Stepanek \u00a0Signs your team need a shared inboxStill wondering if your company needs a shared inbox?If you and your team are experiencing the below challenges, then you should surely consider using a shared inbox.1. Problem \u2013 Sharing information is an arduous taskReceived an information that you need to share with your teammate? How will you do it? By forwarding it?If that teammate thinks that another person in the team should be informed about the matter, he/she will again forward it further. These forwards eventually turn into long, confusing threads that consume your and the teammate\u2019s precious time.How can shared inbox help? In a shared inbox, everything is streamlined at one place. From sales and marketing to customer success team, everyone is on the same page. Each team member can see the email sent by the client, so you don\u2019t need to move across different platforms to share information. It is the best way to keep everyone in the team updated without doing the extra work.2. Problem \u2013 Confusion due to collaborationIt is great to work together; collaboration makes work faster and easier. But sometimes when things aren\u2019t handled systematically, there are unnecessary confusion and complications.You don\u2019t know who has replied and what has been committed to the client. There is no clarity; it becomes difficult to decide the next step. If multiple people email the client with the same matter, then that might annoy them and affect your relationship.How can shared inbox help?With team inbox, there is more transparency. You know what\u2019s happening as you are a part of everything. Even the minutest change is visual so that you can make informed decisions. Stop appearing as a foreigner wandering in unknown land without any information of the past communication.A shared inbox allows you to keep track of the context to have a more meaningful conversation with your prospects. You\u2019ll know what had been discussed and from where you need to continue or what do you need to avoid. Each team member can stay on track and offer excellent service to the client without stepping on each other\u2019s foot.3. Problem \u2013 BCC\u2019ing is a hassleYou draft an email and then remember you need to keep your teammate in the loop. So, you BCC him. Easy isn\u2019t it?Well not really. Sadly, he won\u2019t receive the reply of the client. And if in case you forget to inform him about the message received by the client, there will be more chaos and you might land up in trouble.How can shared inbox help?Avoid the BCC\u2019ing hassle with a shared inbox, as teammates who have the access can see the clients\u2019 replies. \u00a0If in case, you need someone\u2019s help you can instantly mention them inside the note. He/she will be notified to act in real-time. Instead of working individually, you can work together as a team using this shared inbox.4. Problem \u2013 Internal churn is a major hurdleYou surely wouldn\u2019t want an opportunity to exit with your employee. If the communication your employee had with your prospect isn\u2019t streamlined in one place, then it would be difficult to take the deal forward. The person replacing that employee wouldn\u2019t know what had been discussed earlier. He will have to ask the prospects to repeat details which they might not like as it would be time-consuming.How can shared inbox help?

            "content": "\u201cWould you like coke or fries with that?\u201dHaven\u2019t you heard this question at KFC or McDonalds while purchasing your favorite burger or chicken bucket?Recommending complementary or related product/service is one common sales strategy used by companies to make instant profit. No matter which industry you belong to, it can be used to motivate the buyers for purchasing more products from you. This sales technique is popularly known as cross-selling.It is the best way to drum-up the sales of your small business, provided you do it in the right way. Cross-selling doesn\u2019t mean you offer a product just for the sake of selling it.Cross-selling involves foreseeing the client\u2019s needs and offering a relevant product that works best with the original product. It should provide real advantages to the user.Let\u2019s delve a bit deeper and understand what is cross-selling?Defining cross-sellingCross-selling is presenting the value of complementary or related products or services that will render more benefits to the buyer if purchased together. You pair products that work well together like shampoo and conditioner, phone and memory card, bread and cheese, etcCross-selling has worked for companies of all sizes, for instance, Amazon attributes up to 35% of their revenue from cross-selling.Cross-selling is an art that needs to be mastered. You have a buyer who is already interested in one product, so your half work is done. You just need to put in a little more effort and show him the benefits of getting the other with it. With cross-selling, you can earn more profit in each transaction.Did you ever notice those little things arranged near the sales counter in a store? Well, that is kept there on purpose. Children get enough time to convince their parents to pick chocolate or a toy while waiting in the billing queue.Even on various e-commerce sites, you will see suggestions of products that go well with the existing purchase. Such suggestions sometimes encourage the buyers to make an impulse purchase which results in profitable sales for the company.Cross-selling examplesHere are a few cross-selling examples that will help you in understanding this concept more clearly.Cross-selling example 1: A clothing retailer suggests a winter cap to a buyer purchasing a jacket.Cross-selling example 2: A sales representative from an insurance company targeted his current customers living in an area experiencing a flood.He bundled homeowner insurance with flood insurance and presented it to his customers saying that \u201cyour current insurance only covers water inside the home; by getting flood insurance, you can protect your home from an influx of water outside your home as well\u201d.Cross-selling example 3: A web development company suggests digital marketing services to a current client who recently got their website developed.Benefits of cross-sellingIf you are selling more than one product, then you should consider cross-selling as it has a wide spectrum of benefits. Each product has certain strengths; when used together, it gives the buyer more benefits.You just need to connect the one with the other smartly. If effectively executed, this useful technique can help in maximizing your small business profits.Here are various benefits of cross-selling:1. Increasing revenueThe more products a customer purchases, the better will be your revenue growth. But for this, you need to put the right things together. The best combinations can help in winning more sales.Most of the customers don\u2019t mind spending if they get value for the money spent. So, you should know how to present the value by connecting both the products.Cross-selling is like feeding two birds with one seed. By enhancing the buying experience, you gain the trust of the customers, and you earn good profit by convincing the customer to buy a complementary product.2. Better customer retention When a customer spends more, he is likely to make the most of the product. If your combination is perfect and it provides the promised value, then there are chances that he might use your product for long.High customer satisfaction most of the time results in future purchases. When customers see the benefits of both the products together, they tend to purchase both the product again instead of getting one.Cross-selling doesn\u2019t only boost your customer retention rate but also acquaints you to new opportunities. Satisfied customers often share their positive experiences with others. They write reviews or recommend your products to their networks.\u201cIf you do build a great experience, customers tell each other about that, word of mouth is very powerful\u201d- Jeff Bezos 3. Customers become more loyal to your brand Haven\u2019t you frequently bought multiple products of the same brand? When customers purchase a product and find it good, they prefer buying more products from the same place.In cross-selling, you have better chances to make a good impression on the buyers as you can sell two products at the same time.

Technologies have introduced automation to ease our work. Then why not make the most of it? Sales automation increases productivity and minimizes inefficiencies. It is the best way to do more in less time.Unfortunately, some sales reps don\u2019t use it which is why they often experience low sales. They are stuck at the same point without knowing how to stem the tide of activities. They keep complaining about these activities that consume their time and affect their sales.However, complaining doesn\u2019t work in sales. In this highly-competitive modern business world, it is necessary to embrace the latest technologies and tactics to increase the pace of work.Sales automation is one such modern tool that has helped many top performers in eliminating manual labor and reducing repetitive tasks like tracking and reporting expenses for quickly reaching their sales targets.Let\u2019s see how sales automation tools helped the top sales performers in winning more sales and being better than the rest:1. Automate call logsEvery detail related to a sales call is of pivotal importance for a sales rep. It is necessary to know everything like who called when they called, what was the call duration, etc.Most of the sales reps collect these sales call data manually, and so waste a lot of time. But, some of the top-performing sales reps choose to use sales automation tools for automatically logging their sales calls.With automated call logging, they get all the information about their inbound and outbound calls at their fingertips without any hassle. This information can be compelling. It can keep sales reps on pace and help them in improving their sales call performance.2. Automating follow up emails\u201cI need to email the detail about ___to ___ tomorrow.\u201d Sales reps write such follow-up information in a piece of paper and sometimes misplace it. Besides, due to a busy schedule, they even tend to forget about it.Failing to remember such follow-ups can have some unwanted repercussions. To ensure such vital tasks don\u2019t slip through the cracks, top sales performers use automated emails for their follow-ups.By setting some simple workflows, they automate their outbound emails. For instance, \u201csend a product walkthrough after three days of sending an introductory email.\u201dTop performers create such drip campaigns to stay on track. Giving attention to the prospect at the right time increases their possibilities of moving ahead in the sales cycle.Besides, some top performers also create date-based custom fields in their sales automation tool for birthdays and anniversaries and run workflows on them.So, during birthdays and anniversaries of the clients, they are reminded to send greetings to those customers. In this way, they nurture and build long-term relationships with the customers.3. Automate lead distributionMarketing teams put in a lot of efforts and fill the sales pipeline with leads. Most of these leads stay there for long. This happens because some of the sales professionals don\u2019t have the time to keep a check on it.When they finally remember about those leads, they randomly assign it to their team members.Some prospects don\u2019t have the time to wait; that\u2019s why they need immediate solutions for their problems. By the time the lead is assigned, and the sales representative contacts the prospect, it is too late.The prospect easily finds an alternate solution in that period. Many opportunities are lost due to such haphazard management of the leads.To avoid this, the top sales performers, automate this process of assigning new leads to the sales reps. Define the workflows that automatically gets triggered when a new lead is created.A lot of time is saved by automating this task of assigning leads. Moreover, the leads get attention in real-time.4.

            "content": "Every business today must allow options to its customers to directly reach out to them. When a business is small, the front desk phone comes in handy for that purpose, yet, it is a chargeable option.When businesses grow, they need to find an option that doesn\u2019t cost customers and makes them reach out to the business.Having a toll free number allows businesses to show their customers that they are available 24/7 without charging a penny.A successful business runs highly on various working components. One of those components \u2013 customer service, has seen its share of growth in the past.The competitors today are ready to snatch away customers at the sight of customer disappointment. Any business that fails to provide solid customer service is going to falter.What is a toll-free number?The toll-free number also called freephone number is used for calling the company without being charged for the call. Toll-free phone numbers work with all types of phones and landlines.You might have seen these numbers on billboards, handouts, pamphlets and even on businesses websites. Common prefixes are such as 800, 888, 877, 866, 855 or 844.The incoming charges on such connections are paid by businesses so that the customers can reach out to them free of any calling charges. In simple language, the cost of making a call to the toll-free number is charged to the business and not the customer.Benefits of having a toll free number for every business ownerThere is no point in making something part of your business if it doesn\u2019t come with any benefit. In this part, we will explain the benefits of having toll free numbers for every business owner.1. Toll-free numbers improve customer retentionMany times, customers end up finding out that there is no way to get in touch with the business directly. The idea of not being able to reach out leaves a bad impression on the customers and hampers credibility.The modern business world is all about providing a mode of connectivity to your customers because that\u2019s how business gets conducted today.In such a modern era, if you do not provide your customers with a medium of connecting, they will feel ignored and unappreciated.Having a toll free number helps businesses to improve their customer service as it enhances customer satisfaction. With a toll-free number in front of them, they will never hesitate from reaching out to you.The more they reach out the more things you learn about your business and can improve upon them. The advantage of making a call to the business at any time without paying is like a bonanza for customers.2. Toll-free phone numbers are easy to rememberAn 1800 number for business is easy to remember when compared to any other number. When it\u2019s easy to remember a business toll-free number, customers are more likely to get in touch with the business.Toll-free numbers can enhance customer experience and in turn, increase the revenue of the business too.3. Toll-free numbers help increase the credibilityToll-free numbers are a great tool for companies of all shapes and sizes, especially startups. Being a newcomer, if you provide a toll-free phone number to your customers, it will help in building better credibility.4. Toll-free numbers offer portabilityLet\u2019s take a short jog down history first.AT&T was the first telecommunication service provider that introduced toll-free phone numbers in 1967. Only 1-800 prefix was available at that point in time.Soon, businesses started realizing the potential of a toll-free number. However, portability was a major issue in those days. If a business faced any inconvenience with a service provider, they had to change the entire toll-free phone number.To have a common ground in this issue, FCC (Federal Communications Commission) decided that toll-free numbers must be made portable.What portability does is, it allows the business owners to retain their old toll-free phone numbers even if they change the service provider.Businesses can continue to receive calls from their customers even if they are planning to relocate as the toll-free number is portable.5. You can easily monitor your campaignsLet\u2019s say you are running a few marketing campaigns. Many campaigns might be running on billboards or other print and digital media. Once you assign these campaigns with their allotted toll-free numbers, you can start tracking multiple details about your campaigns.You can track the details of the customers reaching out to you for all those individual campaigns. Also, their geographic location and their most preferred hour of making calls.These are some of the advertising channels where toll-free numbers can be incorporated:broadcast ads,direct response campaigns,email campaigns.How small business owners can get their toll-free numbers?I hope the benefits that I have explained were able to convince you that toll-free numbers are beneficial to any size of business.Building trust and credibility is the need of the hour for startups as they need to scale quickly."

            "content": "The traditional sales reps were running around, looking for prospects, pitching their products and services to random people who may or may not have wanted it.Their conversation was awkward, confrontational and at times, cringe-worthy, not to mention the level at which they were struggling to convince the prospects about buying from them.Today, things have changed, people are aware, maybe more informed than the sales reps. The sales reps require a certain edge over the modern prospects to pitch, convince and close their SaaS sales deals.What is SaaS sales?Never mention the price first!Technology has reshaped every industry today, and with that significant changes have come to the sales front too. SaaS sales involve the concerned sales reps selling web-based software to the prospects.Their task regularly includes new customer acquisition, up-selling and cross-selling, and retaining their most valued clients.SaaS sales reps, like every modern sales rep, must approach their prospects by first mentioning the benefits and features of their solution.For that, reps must be well-versed about their solution and should quickly respond to customer queries!Listening to the prospects and understanding their problems is the most crucial step that no SaaS sales rep should forget.Treating the prospects as an individual rather than a name in their sales list is the best approach.How is SaaS sales different?With free trials, consulted purchasing and monthly subscriptions customers can quickly stop, switch their SaaS services. Customers can easily check information about what they are buying and whom they are buying it\u00a0from.Consultant: a person who provides expert advice professionally.Steps for SaaS sales reps to think like consultantsSaaS sales is high risk \u2013 high reward!Sales is crucial for every organization, and we do not need to put too much effort in making you understand that your entire ROI depends on it. Exemplify our customer-first values with the following tips:1. Understand your prospects business modelCustomers feel more comfortable speaking to experts who want to listen to them about their business process and help them with their problems. Consultants act as partners who help prospects improve the way they carry out their business processes.In consultative selling, sales rep must understand the prospect\u2019s business and know how things work for or against them. This task must be carried out by the SaaS sales reps before providing a product-fit assessment of the prospect.If you are a SaaS sales rep who works under the \u201cJob-to-be-Done\u201d norm, you won\u2019t be able to conduct consultative selling with adequate precision.Try finding the uses of your product that the prospect might be unaware of!Factors to consider for gaining a deeper understanding of your prospects\u2019 business:Their business model \u2013 what are their goals, revenue model,\u00a0competitive advantage and market opportunity?Their customer\u2019s purchasing behavior \u2013 how their customers acquire a product or service?Their pricing structure \u2013 how does their pricing structure work?Ways of enabling the SaaS solution \u2013 Are they interested in a Freemium, tiered, subscription-based cycle, etc.?Their customer base \u2013 What\u2019s the customer base? What\u2019s common between them? Are they B2B SaaS, e-commerce, etc.?)Many prospects will approach you with issues that they see or have noticed, unaware of other problems that might be prevailing beneath the surface.There are endless reasons for which the prospects reach out to the sales representatives.Many of them will be reaching out to you because they just scaled their organization and wanted a SaaS solution that can meet their team size or they want to get more support because of the upcoming product launch.Using consultative selling ascertain and advise which of your features are apt for them today and which one will help them in the future.You can do this only when you truly understand how their business process works.If prospects achieve better results with your consultative selling, they will recommend others too!2. Don\u2019t sell, provide data-based perspectiveDon\u2019t suggest something that is generalized!Your prospects have reached out to you or have shown interest in your solution because they did not find what they were looking for! Then you popped up on their research radar.And just like a confused shopper at the mall who approaches the store guide with their requirement inside an overcrowded mall, your prospects approached you.Yes, providing the prospect with the all-in-one-package is an essential part of your job, but that is to be done under the regular sales rep regime. When you adopt consultative selling, you must concentrate on providing a tailored solution to your prospects.Many times, prospects will try to hide the challenges they are facing while using their current solutions. In such cases, you must give them use cases, or use storytelling and positioning statements.Doing so allows them to feel relieved that they are not alone"

            "content": "\u2018Sales objection\u2019 is one of the major hurdles that sales reps face during their sales journey. Most of the sales reps lose maximum deals at this stage of the sales process. This mostly happens because they either give up or aren\u2019t aware of the right ways to tackle the sales objections.Sales objections arise when a sales prospect has a concern regarding the product/service. For achieving positive sales results, you\u2019ll have to handle these concerns wisely.Getting aggressive or arguing with them won\u2019t help. Your response to their concerns should be strong enough to change their minds and bring them to a different conclusion. The success rate is 64% if you can understand a buyer\u2019s objection.What is objection handling?\u00a0Objection handling is a crucial part of the sales process where sales reps address all the objections of the prospects to move them ahead in the sales pipeline.\u00a0Objection handling needs to be done in the right way without infuriating the prospects.Some sales reps get defensive and tend to argue after hearing an objection. Due to that, they end up losing a deal.\u00a0For handling objections, the sales reps need to be calm and polite. Listening is an essential skill required for objecting handing. The sales reps must understand the client\u2019s concern and then find out a midway that\u2019s beneficial for both.\u00a0Common sales objections and how to handle them wiselyEffective objection handling can take you closer to your sales goals. Here are the most common sales objections that block the success route of the sales professionals:1. \u201cPrice is too high\u201dRegardless of what you are selling, there are high chances you\u2019ll come across buyers who have a problem with the pricing of the product. Well, no one likes to spend their precious dollars.Most of the sales reps instantly lower the price or offer a discount when a client raises the price objection. But that\u2019s like compromising with the company\u2019s profits.How to handle this sales objection?Instead of taking the easy road, try to get creative by displaying the value of your product.Create a connection between the price and the value; you need to justify the pricing of your product smartly.Give examples of your satisfied clients and explain how your product has helped in solving a specific problem.2. \u201cNeed to consult__\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll consult my boss/partner and get back to you\u201d. In most of the cases, such prospects never return. This is just a stalling tactic used by most of the disinterested prospects. Don\u2019t fall into the trap and wait for them.How to handle this sales objection?Try to set up a joint meeting with both parties.Ask them if they could connect you directly with the decision-maker.Give them a situation like \u201dif at all your partner asks you to make the decision what you would do\u201d?3. \u201cSend me some information\u201dThis is the most common excuse used by prospects to escape a conversation. Sometimes you don\u2019t even get a chance to present the value proposition of your product or ask qualification questions.Don\u2019t just send the information and surrender the deal. Take charge of the situation and ensure your sales prospect doesn\u2019t hang up before answering the vital questions.How to handle this sales objection?Be polite and reply-\u201cI\u2019d be glad to email the information, but before that, I\u2019d suggest we take a couple of minutes now to discuss your current business challenges.\u201d\u201cYes sure, but before that would you mind if I ask you a few questions now to understand how we call help you in improving your process.\u201d4. \u201cDon\u2019t have the need right now\u201dIt\u2019s human nature that most people don\u2019t look for a change until they experience any severe trouble. Few businesses are so comfortable with their current operations that they are not ready to try something new.Take them out of their comfort zone and show them the bigger picture. Make them realize the profits they are missing by not embracing the change.How to handle this sales objection?Give examples of customers who have made similar changes that you are suggesting.Mention the benefits the customers received with the positive change.Show them what problems would they face in the future if they don\u2019t react now.5. \u201cWe are already working with_______(your competitor)\u201dYou might come across companies who are already using your competitor\u2019s product. However, that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t draw their attention towards your product.

            "content": "As a sales professional, you want to convert a potential sales prospect into a paying customer quickly. But are the needs and concerns of your prospect the central part of this conversion plan? If not, then your sales journey might get a bit difficult.There are chances that the prospects might exit your sales cycle at any stage due to dissatisfaction. For avoiding this from happening, it is essential to understand your sales prospect needs and build a good rapport with them. This can be done through the medium of consultative selling.What\u2019s there for you in this article:What is consultative selling?Consultative approach vs. product-focused sellingPowerful steps to optimize consultative sellingFinal Words\u201cKnow what your customers want most and what your company does best. Focus on where the two meet\u201d \u2013 Kevin Stirtz What is consultative selling?Consultative selling is an approach that focuses on buyer needs. In simple terms, a sales professional acts as a consultant and helps the prospect in finding a solution for their ongoing problem.Instead of making a sales pitch, sales reps try to engage the buyers in a meaningful dialogue using their questioning skills. Through such substantive interaction, the sales rep discovers the prospect\u2019s most pressing business issues.Then genuine efforts are made to overcome these issues of the sales prospect.The philosophy behind consultative selling\u00a0Consultative selling is based on a formula of strategic questioning. Socrates, the great philosopher, used strategic questioning to help his pupils solve problems, ferment complex ideas, and come to their own conclusion.\u00a0Implementing Socratic questioning while using consultative selling methodology can be really helpful. Most of the time, prospects aren\u2019t aware of their problems. By asking strategic questions, you help the prospects put their problems in their own words.While answering the questions, the prospects realize what their true needs and challenges are. Moreover, by listening to the prospect\u2019s business pain points from a caring and attentive standpoint, you are building a foundation of trust. The prospects will be more interested in hearing your proposal as you\u2019ve taken the time to hear them first.\u00a0Benefits of consultative selling\u00a0When the sales reps adopt a consultative sales approach, their mindset changes. They begin focusing on building trust-based relationships. Sales reps start asking probing questions that reveal the prospect\u2019s current state and desired future state. Due to their courteous treatment and excellent performance they are perceived as trusted advisors by the prospectsThe consultative sales methodology helps sales reps in attaining quotas, improving customer satisfaction, and increasing customer referrals.\u00a0There are several benefits of adopting the consultative sales technique.\u00a0It helps in increasing business revenue by improving the closure rate.Shortens sales cycle by gaining potential buyers\u2019 trust and confidence.Encourage positive word of mouth by providing an excellent buying experience.Consultative approach vs. product-focused sellingThe significant difference between the two is that in product-focused selling emphasis is laid on the product while in consultative selling it is all about the buyers.In product-focused selling:Companies are concerned about their profits\u2018Self-centric\u2019 approachSales professional speaks more and listens lessSales rep highlights the product\u2019s featuresSales reps assume that the prospects need the productIn consultative sellingCompanies are focused on customer\u2019s profit\u2018Customer-centric\u2019 approachSales professional listens attentively to the prospects and asks relevant questionsHighlights the benefits and ROI the buyers will receiveSales reps put in efforts to understand if the prospect really needs their productIt is tough to survive with a product-centric approach in the modern buying environment where the buyers are quite smart and well-informed.If you don\u2019t pay attention to their concerns, they will instantly switch towards your competitors.

            "content": "A sales call isn\u2019t just a medium to reach your customers, but it also holds a wealth of information that can help you in closing a deal successfully.The human mind cannot store all this information for long; there are chances you might forget it.Albert Einstein rightly said, \u201cWhy should I fill my brain with facts I can find in two minutes.\u201d So be smart and jot down every important point your client mentions on a sales call. Creating sales notes eliminates the odds of missing crucial insights.Think about this, don\u2019t you get annoyed when in a restaurant the waiter doesn\u2019t take note and serves the wrong dish.Like you, even your customers get infuriated when they are asked to repeat the same thing. By referring to the sales notes, you can easily continue the conversation from where you left last.Must-have sales notesNotes are crucial for sales. However, to ensure you don\u2019t waste your precious time, you must develop effective note-taking practices. Be selective in deciding what should be there in your sales notes.Here are five sales notes that you should make during or after a sales call to recall everything you require for progressing the sales.Take notes during the sales call 1. Details about your deal or contactPeople get promoted or change numbers, so you need to create notes of such information. Prospects will inform you about such updates only when you build a good connection with them.Don\u2019t hesitate in asking personal information like the birthday or work anniversary dates to send greeting emails. As per research, birthday emails are a great investment\u00a0for any company; they have 481% higher\u00a0conversion rates compared to promotional DEMs.Note their LinkedIn or Twitter usernames and follow them to stay abreast of their activities.Taking notes of such personal details will help in building a healthy customer relationshipKeep yourself updated with the necessary contact detail changes for staying connected with your prospectsWith social media details, you can explore the prospect\u2019s network and spot opportunities2. Key bits of sales informationWhile communicating with sales prospects, there are high chances of getting various \u2018buying clues\u2019. So, stay attentive and make a note of all those crucial details.Show curiosity in knowing more about them by asking relevant questions. Pay attention to each answer and pick the vital points. 84% of customers are frustrated\u00a0when sales professionals don\u2019t have the correct information.The prospects might speak about their expectations, business challenges, bad experiences they had with your competitors.The information noted during the sales conversation comes handy while building strategies or plans of action for converting the deal.Such notes are even useful when sales reps handling the account leaves the organization and a new rep needs to replace themTake notes after the sales call1. Actionable commitment and follow-up tasksThere are chances of losing a deal when you fail to keep a commitment you made to the client.Once the call ends, you need to create a to-do list to stay on the right track. Reflect on the sales call and ask yourself what you need to do next.Did you commit to giving a discount?Has the prospect asked you to call them after three days?Did the prospect ask for a product demo?Do you need to email them any specific details of the pricing plan?Take note of all these tasks to follow-up in real-time and adhere to the commitments for providing a good buying experience.Research shows that 55% of consumers are willing to pay more for a guaranteed good experience.Save big bucks on virtual phone systemMake international calls with built-in calling!Try Salesmate for Free2.

            "content": "Email copywriting is a subtle art that can make all the difference to your bottom-line sales. It\u2019s all about being able to tap into what people are thinking, en masse, and create urgency by presenting a solution that needs to be bought and paid for as soon as possible.There\u2019s a line to be walked between creating urgency, and looking like you\u2019re too keen to make a sale. Let\u2019s take a look at how you can strike the right balance.There\u2019s a line to be walked between creating urgency, and looking like you\u2019re too keen to make a sale. Let\u2019s take a look at how you can strike the right balance.Decide on the emotions that you want to tap intoEmotions are a funny thing, in that they\u2019re very easy to stir up in people, but rather difficult to channel in a coherent direction. The first thing you need to do is to decide which emotions you want to tap into; this will depend largely on the nature of your products and services.\u201cThere\u2019s no use in being emotive for the sake of it. All this will do, is leave your customers feeling bemused as they receive a barrage of rhetoric. I strongly recommend taking the time to decide which emotions fit with the nature of your products and services\u201d \u2014 says Luke Thompson, Content Marketer at Resumes Centre.Clearly, if you have a luxury product you\u2019re selling to high net worth clients, you need to approach things in a different manner than if you were selling a low-cost product in lower-income households.Selling luxury is all about creating desire, and then combining it with the fear of having to make do with something less desirable. Whereas selling a low-cost item is all about showing you can quickly and easily solve an annoying problem.You want to create a sense of wasted time and annoyance, and then position yourself as the solution the reader has been looking for.Create a list of emotive words which chime with your email copywritingCreating a list of key emotive words is the next step, and it\u2019s one that will be of great benefit once you start drafting your first round of content.Always ask yourself whether the wording you\u2019ve put together chimes with the emotions that you\u2019re trying to evoke. You should also ensure that the words you put down fit with the core ethos of your brand.For example, if you\u2019re offering a time-saving product that makes people\u2019s lives easier, you don\u2019t want too many fearful or stressed words on your list.You need to make people feel they need your product, but you can\u2019t overdo things as you need to project the sense that you\u2019ll be a calming presence in their lives.Always keep the core aspects of your brand within your focus Projecting your brand is the main purpose of this exercise. You may think that it\u2019s to generate sales, and it is to an extent, but only through a long-term sustainable approach.Stay true to your brand so that you can grow organically and provide a sense of identity that your customers can tap into.\u201cWe always work to ensure that our brand is our focus. Experience has shown many times over, that it\u2019s all too easy to lose sight of the big picture\u201d \u2014 says Chris Mercer, Freelance Marketer and Founder of Citatior.A scattergun approach that creates a memorable headline may sell you a few extra products to begin with, but in the long term, it will just confuse people.Creating a storyboard is a great way to organize an email sequence. That way you\u2019ll be able to ask yourself whether all of your content is pulling in the same direction, or if it\u2019s shooting off to the sides in the hope of making a sale.Write in a conversational tone that will connect with your audience Most people ignore spammy emails from companies trying to sell them something, but everyone takes the time to read a thoughtful message from a friend or loved one.The reason for this is that they know the latter will offer them something of value for little or nothing in return. You can use this simple bit of psychology to find the right tone for your emails.A conversational tone is often the most engaging style to use. It allows you to add the human touch to your prose, be more emotive, and creates text that\u2019s more readable.If you\u2019re looking for external input on how to go about this, then there are a variety of different online tools that you can make use of:CoSchedule: Offers an intuitive way to decide on a timeline that will help your emails reinforce the messaging of your previous mailshot.Essay Supply: Connects you with writers who will help you tap into the emotional psyche of your target audience.Online Writers Rating: Allows you to search professional writers who will be able to find the right words to project your brand to a larger market.MailChimp: Offers a variety of learning resources that will enable you to tailor your efforts to meet the needs of a specific market.Create urgency by highlighting scarcity, but don\u2019t overdo itAny useful tool for sales will enable you to create a sense of urgency around your offering.

            "content": "Winning back lost customers is an important growth strategy, especially for businesses operating on a recurring revenue model.Think about the efforts, money, and resources you need to acquire a new customer. Instead, why not sharpen and use the old sword?It is easier to sell to your former customer who is already acquainted with your product.As per a study, there are 20 to 40% chances of winning back an ex-customer and only a 5 to 20 % chance of turning a new prospect into a paying customer.Your most unhappy customers are your greatest source of learning- Bill GatesLook at this through an optimistic lens; your unhappy customers are giving you a chance to get better for surpassing your competitors. Rather than abandoning them, find out and fix the problems in your offering. Customers don\u2019t instantly decide to quit.It is a gradual decision based on the experience of using your product. There might be something lacking or going wrong that showed them the exit door.Like \u2013The customers might not be happy with your priceYour solution isn\u2019t solving their problemYour product hasn\u2019t kept up with timeThey \u00a0feel your competitor is betterTo win such lost customers, you need to up your game.\u201cYou can always improve your situation. But you do so by facing it, not by running away\u201d \u2013 Brad WarnerHere are a few tips to win back lost customer:1. Find out why do your customers leaveFor winning back lost customers, you will have to dig into the reason to understand why they left in the first place.Be honest with yourself while finding the cause. Did you fail to deliver the promised service? Or were they lured away by your competitor offering better prices and benefits?Send surveys to learn why the subscribers left and improve your service based on their feedback.Reflect on the past sales data and create reports for determining your strengths and weaknesses that gave them a reason to leave.Conduct competitive analysis for understanding what\u2019s motivating your customers to buy from your competitors.2. Spot and segment the lost customersThere are some past accounts that you shouldn\u2019t touch as you will just end up wasting your time. Analyze the wealth of information you have about your customers and find out potential win-back targets.Separate the wheat from the chaff by segmenting the customers to estimate how likely are the chances for a specific client to return.Create four segments from the database of lost customers to create win-back strategies and prioritize your time productively:Unprofitable customers whom you removed from the sales pipeline (accounts not to be touched)Customers who were price sensitiveThose who were attracted to your competitors due to special offers and additional featuresCustomers whose expectations you couldn\u2019t meet3. Take responsibility for the inconvenience caused and offer special discountsOverselling and under-delivering can endanger customer relationships. That is why you should always choose your words wisely while communicating with your clients to avoid churns.If your customer canceled the subscription due to some genuine glitches, then take the responsibility of the issue and extend a sincere apology.To compensate, offer special discountsTry to regain their trust with dedicated servicesReduce the price of your subscription service for a few months4. Keep upgrading your featuresCustomers want to work with the best; so, ensure you always stay updated with the changing trends. Keep upgrading and introducing new features for providing optimum user experience.Discuss the issues your former customers faced while using your product. Don\u2019t only try to make a minor adjustment but focus on improving your product.Invest a little in upgrades and new features to attract the old customersFor example, Netflix is planning to spend around 85% on original content for keeping its subscribers hookedDon\u2019t lose hope; contact your lost customers after the upgrades and demonstrate the value of your product properly5. Use emails to reach your lost customersMake the most of the email addresses lying in your contact database. Through effective email campaigns, try to get back customers who ceased to pay.Use various strategies like asking them \u201cdo you want us to take you off the newsletter list?\u201d If they give a positive response, then you still have an opportunity to convince them.Send newsletters about new upgrades and featuresKeep sending emails about special offers and discountsSend greeting emails on festivals and special occasions to make them feel special6. Do the unexpectedThink about the times when you were upset or annoyed, and someone did something unexpected to bring a smile on your face. Winning back lost customers isn\u2019t an easy task, it needs efforts. So, walk the extra mile and try doing unexpected things to get into the good books of your customers.\u00a0Offer some freebies Mention them in your blogsOffer round the clock customer support to help them use the product effectively\u00a0Design email sequences, just like y"

However, the question is, how to capitalize on these opportunities?There are very fewer possibilities for closing a sale during the event. You\u2019ll hardly find someone who would be ready to purchase on the spot. Anyone would think before investing their precious dollars, which is understandable. But that doesn\u2019t mean they will never buy.Yes, some people visit a trade show only to explore the product and build new networks. But amidst them, you\u2019ll even find entrepreneurs who are trying to find a solution for their ongoing business problems.They are your high potential prospects whom you need to nurture and convert gradually. The best way to do it is by taking the help of a customer relationship management (CRM) software.CRM software \u2013 The sales support for trade show exhibitors\u201cHow you gather, manage and use information will determine whether you win or lose.\u201d\u00a0-Bill GatesTrade shows are lucrative events where you collect large amount of information that if used wisely can help in increasing your business sales.Your real task begins when this event ends.

Gain control over your salesIn a trade show, you\u2019ll meet people belonging to different sectors of the same industry. To stay on track, you can create multiple pipelines for each sector in the CRM.This would ease your sales management task and render better visibility of your sales cycle.

Every deal in your database is valuable. So, immediately after the trade show, make sure you build a connection with each prospect.During the trade show, prospects receive multiple brochures and flyers so there are chances they might not read your product brochures.

We are aware of the difficulties in winning a sale, but the question is what are we doing about it.Just yelling at your sales rep for not performing or being disappointed with a new hire who is struggling to understand your sales process won\u2019t help in increasing your sales.Instead, take a wiser step and create a sales playbook? Show your new hires how is the game played and reveal some secret tactics to win the sales to your experienced players.Sales playbook explainedSales Playbook is your sales GPS that shows you the way to sales success. Before I go any further, let me briefly explain what sales playbook is, and how can it help sales reps.It is a collection of useful sales materials that clearly define the sales process and methodology, outlines roles and responsibilities, details selling tactics and techniques, and provides a systematic framework for closing deals.A sales playbook-\nKeeps the sales team on trackHelps managers to coach efficientlyHighlights the practices that the best sales reps are using to excel at each stage of the sales processGives sales reps a better understanding of what they are selling and whom they are selling toIt eliminates ambiguity, confusion, and misstepsDefines a clear structure for improving sales performanceLays basic step and strategies to complete a sales cycle successfullyActs as a coaching tool to get the new hires up to speed quicklyThe preparationA sales playbook needs extensive research and efforts. Do your homework well before creating the sales playbook:1. Establish your vision and missionA sales playbook cannot begin until you don\u2019t understand the vision and mission of your company. Here, you need to be precise and honest; you cannot just bluff anything.Tap the cabin of the CEO and try to understand what is your company\u2019s objective, core values, and mission. Gain knowledge about where do your company aims to reach in the coming years.Incorporate these mission, vision and core values in your sales playbook, so the sales reps get a clear understanding of the objective of your company and work with unwavering determination to achieve it.Your sales reps should be able to convey your core values while communicating with the clients. This will help in creating a good image of your company.2. Identify best practices of top sales repAs thought leader, you need to be aware of your sales team capabilities; this helps in accentuating the positives and mitigating the weaknesses. Spot the best performers and take a closer look at their practices. Understand what are they trying to do to excel.Analyze the buying process to identify the success factors of your best performers. Try to track their outbound activities; a sales CRM can help you in this.With a CRM, you can even get insightful sales reports on the past sales information. This can help you in identifying the most effective steps taken by the best performing sales reps.3. Assess the current sales scenarioCommence by understanding the present sales scenario and identify the gaps by reviewing current materials, tools and customer research. Analyze the present state of profitability.However, remember that you don\u2019t only need to focus on the best sales practices but also on the customer purchasing model.Try to understand-\nHow do customers prefer to buy?What source of information do they rely on?How long do they take to make a purchasing decision?What are the factors driving a purchasing decision?Are the customers satisfied with the product?Including customers in your research is the best way to find out what they expect and what do you need to do to meet their expectation because ultimately it is all about your \u2018customers\u2019.4. Go through the sales objectionsThis is the main area of attention where mostly a company loses a deal. So, you need to discuss with your team to discover the objections they face. List the most common ones and try to find a solution to deal with them. See how your best players are dealing with these objections.Conduct a mock calling session with these strong players and record it for the rest of the members of your team. Once your sales team know the tactics, they will be able to handle the objections of the reluctant clients.5. Identify the process for improvementEvaluate your sales process and map out the key steps of the sales process. Outline the entire decision path and identify the areas for improvement.Instead of just simplifying your current process, try to develop a different and more effective process. Describe it clearly through a flowchart so that your sales team can easily understand and adapt it for achieving positive sales results.Creating a sales playbookOnce you gather the necessary information, it is time to create your sales book for leveling up your sales game.

            "content": "Constraints, limitations, and risks are common roadblocks to growth. Entrepreneurs find it difficult to increase their sales with a cash crunch in the early stage of their business, 41% of businesses report having experienced cash flow challenges.So, how to increase sales revenue with a limited budget? \u00a0Sometimes all you need to do is break the routine and create a new roadmap for sales success.Explore different approaches to achieve more with less. No matter how complicated the maze is, there is always a way to get out. Keep your eyes wide open and find that way to boost sales with limited financial resources.I have stated a few of the low budget sales growth ideas below:1. Charge moreEntrepreneur overthink when it comes to increasing the price of their product. Yes, it is a matter of concern because customers avoid purchasing a product with a high price tag.But if handled smartly, this strategy can generate revenues in a great amount. Here, your ability to demonstrate the value of your product is tested. If you succeed, then it can maximize your profit margins.You can start by taking small steps. For example, a study found that raising the price by 1% can increase profits by 11%. However, before raising the prices, ensure you explain the reason for charging more to your existing customers.Make sure your product is good enough for that price range, as customers don\u2019t mind paying more if they can benefit from it.2. Use the power of social mediaSocial media channels are the most effective low budget methods to boost sales of your small business. More than 50 million small businesses currently use Facebook pages to connect with their customers.Join industry-related groups on Facebook and LinkedIn to expand your networks and win new clients.91% of prospective B2B buyers are now active and involved in social media, creating an ample opportunity for your salespeople to have successful sales by engaging with them.Keep sharing useful insights and offers about your products for increasing its visibility. Social media helps in creating high-value bonds with potential prospects provided you use it right.3. Refine your sales pitchIn sales, every word you say matters. So, your sales pitch needs to be impactful enough for motivating your prospects to buy. Don\u2019t be afraid to add humor and showmanship to your sales pitch.Most of the sales professionals sound robotic because they just read from a sales script instead of adding their personality into it. Sometimes you don\u2019t need a big budget but just a little creativity and skills to increase your sales revenue.4. Create special offers and dealsProspects tend to react quickly to discounts. So, announce a limited time offer. Don\u2019t give them much time to think; remember the temporary price breaks on your favorite product that motivated you to take immediate action?Create a sense of urgency to drive faster and better results. Bundle products or create packages to attract the attention of the prospects. By increasing the volume of your product, you can make more sales in less time.5. Listen to your prospects and understand their needs\u201cTo launch a business means successfully solving problems. Solving problems means listening.\u201d \u2013 Richard BransonKnowing what your customers require won\u2019t cost you much. You just need to be attentive and determined to help them. Ask relevant questions to uncover their problems.Render an excellent buying experience by understanding their concerns and expectations. Provide them with a reason for purchasing your solution and removing their roadblock to enhanced revenue growth.6. Use the existing customersYour current customers are the route to reach the new prospects. So, treat them well to encourage word of mouth. Contact them and ask for their feedback. Ensure that they are having a positive experience with your product and help them if they are facing any difficulties.\u201cOne customer well taken care of could be more valuable than $10,000 worth of advertising\u201d- Jim RohnAsk for referrals without appearing desperate or pushy. If you have done good work, then clients won\u2019t mind helping.Satisfied clients can acquaint you with their network who are in need of a similar solution for their business.7. Train and guide your salesforceSharpen your sword by training your sales professionals to win the battle of sales. Build a winning sales culture by exchanging knowledge and experience to strengthen your sales team.Hold regular meetings and see where are your sales reps facing problems while closing the deal. Use a CRM that comes with a built-in virtual phone system to record conversations. Listen to the recorded calls and find the areas of improvement. Conduct mock sales calls to bolster their selling skills.Ask the star performers of the team to help the underachievers by sharing a few tips and tactics to improve their performance.\u201cIt is literally true that you can succeed best and quickest by helping others to succeed\u201d \u2013 Napoleon Hill8.

            "content": "Sales proposals are the heart and soul of every deal. Moreover, that\u2019s what it takes to crack a successful deal; your heart and soul.Not every salesperson feels the same for writing a sales proposal, but after dealing with many successful small and midsize businesses, we have realized the fact that sales proposals are indeed the most potent sales instrument.Why? It is simple, they help you maintain a good closing ratio and churn the economy rate; which means an enhanced revenue generation for your business.What is a good closing ratio?A 50% closing ratio of the pipeline opportunities is considered to be a good closing ratio for businesses of any size or scale. If your sales team is facing a low closing ratio, worry not, it can be improved by solving these two controllable factors.1. Value Perception\u201cThe difference between a prospective customer\u2019s evaluation of the benefits and costs of one product when compared with others\u201d \u2013 WikipediaProviding more discount means quicker deal closure is the myth that many sales personnel work with and it is not the kind of attitude you would want your team members to have. They will only close more deals if the customer can see the value in your product or service.Your offerings value perception starts even before you start your sales process. You will be amazed to know that when the prospects engage with your website and its content, they start perceiving how your offerings will be.In the next stage, the communication with the prospects helps in reinforcing or demolishing that value perception. If you talk in a manner that \u201cwe can work with you on the pricing front\u201d, will undermine all the efforts that you have made till this point.2. Dynamic Sales QualificationWe have observed that when sales representatives are allowed or ordered to close one in every five opportunities, they lose their qualification standard and start pursuing the sales prospects that are less-qualified.Just as value perception begins before the actual sales process, sales qualification follows suit. All the lead generating and nurturing content that is posted to your website must create a \u201cconversation\u201d with the visitors who can be converted into prospects and then get qualified into valuable sales prospects so that your sales team can make the most closure.A quick guide on how you can improve the above two points:Complete understanding of the visitors/prospects business requirementsUnderstand the impact the problem is having on the prospect\u2019s businessUse a\u00a0sales proposal template\u00a0that helps you visualize data, organize information and stick to the point.Provide the prospect/decision-maker with a clear path towards the solutionQualify their budget for your solutionRe-qualify your opportunities during further callsPresent the proposal, preferably in personProvide proper financial justificationPerform trial closeFollow up until you get the final \u201cGo\u201d or a \u201cNo\u201dFocusing on the right things before and during your sales process helps increase the sales ratio to 60% or higher.Writing sales proposals that win businessThe above segment was about addressing the issue with the closing ratio, now, let\u2019s go in-depth with your proposals structure so that you can edge near that perfect closing ratio.1. What are your prospect\u2019s objectives?Writing your proposals solely on the deliverables that your business can offer to the prospect is not the right way of going about it. It is compulsory to include the essential features and benefits of your product or service in the document, but they must not be the focal point of your sales proposal.While writing a successful sales proposal, you must make it a point to include the objectives of your prospects first and then hit them with the solution that your services will provide in achieving those said objectives.Yes, the prospect\u2019s objectives are precious for you to establish a connection with them in your sales proposal.Focus on the critical issues they are currently facing.Point out the ways your service will address those challenges.Doing so will allow you to convert your sales proposals into a powerful tool that outlines the client\u2019s specific objectives and will also build a sense of trust in them about your solution.2. Play precise and to the pointLengthy documents that are filled with jargon do not impress the prospects because they are not looking for them in the first place. They are not going to waste their time going through multiple pages of technical language if you cannot summarize your sales proposals within one-two pages with the required information.Create a sales proposal that prospects will be interested to read all the way through.Concentrate on making your sales proposals concise and relevant.Mention the pain-points that are worrying about the prospect.Don\u2019t include your company\u2019s biography or list of impressive achievements.Put in something relevant in your sales proposal that the prospect will connect to from the first paragraph.3.

They know nothing about their prospect. \u2013\u00a0 Jeffrey GitomerDid you know that 70% of purchasing decisions are made to solve a problem? You might have come across people who hold on to their old phones till it breaks. Only when they reach the end and have a problem in connecting, the thought of purchasing a new phone comes to their mind.The same is the case with most businesses that don\u2019t think about a solution until they have a severe problem to address that threatens their business. For succeeding in sales, it is important to understand and provide a solution to this problem.Learn to sell. In business, you\u2019re always selling\u2013to your prospects, investors, and employees. To be the best salesperson put yourself in the shoes of the person to whom you\u2019re selling. Don\u2019t sell your product. Solve their problems. \u2013 Mark CubanFinding it too complex? Wondering how to do it? \u00a0Don\u2019t worry, Neil Rackham\u2019s SPIN selling model can come to your aid.What is SPIN selling?SPIN selling is a widely adopted model that\u2019s highly relevant in today\u2019s demanding sales environment. It comes from Neil Rackham\u2019s best-selling book\u00a0\u2013 \u201cSPIN Selling\u201d which is based on 12 years of research and analysis of more than 35,000 sales calls.SPIN selling eliminates ambiguity and struggles in closing sales opportunities. It helps in dealing with challenging sales situations and shows sales reps the path to creating healthy connections with customers. Neil Rackham argues that for winning larger consultative deals, sales reps must abandon traditional sales techniques.SPIN selling explains the science behind consultative selling or rather uses the impactful questioning process to discover customer pain points, concerns, challenges, and expectations. It makes the buyers get down to the minute details and understand the problems they are facing.Few essential things about SPIN sellingBefore delving deep into this methodology, here are a few facts and key principles you should follow\nSalespeople trained in the \u201cSPIN\u201d model showed 17% improvement in sales results.SPIN model is not supposed to be used as a checklist of questions. The questions should flow naturally into a conversation.Businesses invest in a solution when the pain of the problem is greater than the cost of the solution.Don\u2019t make the buyer uncomfortable with too many situation questions, instead do your research before connecting.Problem questions require planning; find in advance what problems can your product solve.SPIN selling is useful only when you attentively listen to the answers for the questions asked.SPIN selling- questioning conventional salesThe traditional selling models, methods, and techniques that most of us have been trained to use work best in small sales. For now, let me define small as a sale which can normally be completed in a single call and which involves a low dollar value. Unfortunately, these tried-and-true low-value sales techniques, most of them dating from the 1920s, don\u2019t work today. \u2013 Neil RackhamSPIN selling is the culmination of an in-depth sales study. Many sales professionals displayed interest and supported this project of Neil Rackham. More than half the US fortune 500 still uses this model for training their sales team.Neil Rackham\u2019s study widely criticizes and challenges traditional selling methods. Though this wasn\u2019t his aim; he began this study for validating the effectiveness of traditional methods. However, when he audited the sales processes of large companies like IBM and Xerox the scenario changed.Major large-scale companies were abreast of the ineffectiveness of their sales reps once the sales became complex; especially when the investment demanded a deeper relationship than a simple and single phone call to the client. Having expertise in simple sales doesn\u2019t mean you are good at complex sales too.Most of the traditional sales methodologies were developed around the early years of the 19th century. They were created for simple sales where the client would make a buying decision at the end of the call. Well, such things don\u2019t happen now as the clients have become quite smarter and cautious in making buying decisions. Here the sales reps run into a series of failures which makes sales quite complex. Simple and complex sales are two different worlds.\nSimple sales are mostly the widely available routine products that have a shorter sales cycle. While in the complex process, there are many steps involved in convincing a buyer to make a purchase.The risk of uncertainty is greater in complex compared to simple sales.This implies that both need to be treated differently. In complex sales, sellers are expected to establish a relationship by asking relevant questions to the buyer. They need to gain the buyers\u2019 confidence and make them feel comfortable discussing their business issues. As per the study, there are more chances of completing the sales when the buyers c"

Don\u2019t stop here; you are only 4/6th of the way through the funnel.Be very careful at this stage as it can have an impact on the bottom line of your business.You need to continue delighting your customers by offering attractive annual plans and best-in-class support. 86% of customers will pay more for better customer experience.Once someone makes the payment, your job gets much more comfortable as you know who your customers are and what they need.It is cheaper to drive a repeat purchase from a present satisfied customer then acquiring a new one.Businesses have a 60 to 70% higher chance of selling to an existing customer while the probability of selling to a new prospect is only 5% to 20%.Few mistakes and you will get demoted to the acquisition stage of the funnel where you will have to start it all over again with a new prospect. 33% of Americans say they\u2019ll consider switching companies after just a single instance of poor service.How is revenue linked to the other AARRR metrics?By now you must have realized that none of the AARRR metrics are self-standing, that is why we look at it as a framework.For a company to succeed, it is mandatory to do well at all the stages of the funnel.Let us see how revenue is affected by the other metrics of the AARRR framework:AcquisitionYour revenue will grow with each new customer, but the cost will go up faster.High acquisition cost decreases the net revenue of the company; the more you spend, the less profit you earn.What is the point of getting $300 from a sale when your customer acquisition cost was $250? Therefore, it is necessary to optimize your acquisition strategies and invest in the channel that introduces you to lucrative opportunities.ActivationWrongly acquired lead is like that piece of a jigsaw puzzle that doesn\u2019t fit. You put in all the efforts to complete the puzzle and in the end realize your efforts were in vain because of a single incorrect move.Similarly, during sales activation, a wrong lead can lead to a waste of time, money and resources.They might abandon you at any stage of the funnel, which directly affects the revenue of your business. Read how to activate the right people here.Retention\u201cRetention is the single most important thing for growth\u201d- Alex Schulz If people are unsubscribing your service in a few months or not returning to your store, then how will you increase your revenue? You are just stuck in a vicious circle of acquiring and losing customers.Retention in the only way to reduce churns and boost your revenue. Increasing customer retention rates by 5%, increases revenue by 25% to 95%.ReferralTurn your existing customer into a referral magnet to increase your revenue in a short time. There should be some USP of your product that motivates your users for recommending it to their networks.It is difficult to rely on the customers coming from random sources for steady revenue growth; they might quit at any point.However, the ones referred by a satisfied customer are more likely to stay loyal. Referred customers have a 16% higher lifetime value.Analyze revenue to find out what\u2019s best for youUsing various advanced reporting tools, you can create insightful revenue reports to see how much money you made in the last quarter.While looking at your revenue report ensure you dig deeper and find the source of revenue to know what you need to do to expand your profit margins.Break down the revenue to understand where it is coming from:ChannelCompare the performance of different channels and see from where you are getting maximum revenue. This will help you in spending your marketing budget smartly.CampaignsTrack your campaigns and identify the best-performing ones that are generating revenue.

The general tips for sending out your email prevail in the marketing community.They are best for starting off your campaign. But as we all know, being dynamic also pays off, as you must try out various options for success.1. The General TipsThe basic knowledge to come in handy for those who are thinking of starting their email campaigns as debutantes.Day vs. NightThis will sound obvious but sending out email campaigns during the daytime is your best bet.MondaysAvoid Monday email blasts as everybody is already busy sorting those weekend emails. You don\u2019t want your informational, promotional or influential emails to end up in the junk category.WeekendsHistorically, weekends are the days when folks are out running errands and going on adventures. Weekends tend to have low open rates, so most marketers avoid them like the plague.2. Heads up on event emailsIn a study, GetResponse revealed that around\u00a023% of emails get opened in the first hour. The rest of the outbound emails stay unopened until two or three days after being sent out.Advice:If you want your audience to know about a sale, mega discount or some scheme, drop an email 3-5 days prior to your event.3. The FavoritesAs marketers dread the Monday blues and the Lazy Friday vibe, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday end up in the favorites list. Even Mailchimp mentions that Tuesday and Thursday bag the two most popular spots for sending out emails under your outreach campaign.4. Mid of week and dayMarketing and sales professionals agree that emails perform well when they are sent out during the mid of the week. Especially the ones that are sent during the middle of the day.As per Mailchimp, 2 PM is the best time to send emails and for experiencing the most mail open rates.5. Being dynamic is the key!The above tips are best for practical application under the general email category. The email marketing research done by Wordstream offers much more insight. However, there are situations that quickly challenge the classical suggestions above.Best time for sending emailsWordstream also mentions that the sales email blasts did on Thursday, between 8 \u2013\u00a09 AM get over 25% open rates!The worst time for sending emails:In the same research, they also mention that emails that are sent on Tuesday and Wednesday between 8 \u2013 10 AM underperform; around 5% open rates.6. Handling the rush from competitionNow, let\u2019s get practical. From the above data, it is clear that Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday are the best days for sending out promotional and outreach emails.Yes, Mondays and Fridays are not the best time for traditional emails to pass through the hustle. But who is to say they won\u2019t come in handy for you.The device plays a pivotal roleUser habits differ across various devices. You can say that the above data perfectly align with the users who access their email via desktop at work.\u00a0But a major chunk stays with mobile users who can access their emails from any place. You just need to have a catchy subject line!As the figure above mentions, 52% of emails are opened on mobile devices, 32% are opened vial webmail services and 16% are opened on desktops.For any business, this data concludes that your emails have to be mobile-friendly so that your outreach campaigns have better open rates.Understand your audienceUnderstanding the demographics pertaining to your target audience is crucial for your email outreach success. Observe their habits and serve them well with content that is valuable to both of you.Evening emails could work well with the younger and tech-loving crowd.If you are in the entertainment industry, Friday would reap beneficiary as people prefer to pursue something fun over the weekend.Customize your emails as per the various time-zones where your audience resides.The ultimate answer to \u201cbest time to send email\u201dWell, the answer is simple, and you always had it in your gut-feeling. It all boils down to your audiences and their behavior. Though there are certain weekdays that are recommended by the sales professionals, the mid-day in mid-week is the best time for your outreach emails.But, let us tell one thing very specifically. Blaming the hours is not the way to perform well. You need to be open to testing and experiments. That way you can keep a tab on the perfect send time for your emails for a particular target audience.Open rates of your email are not solely dependent on your send times. If you feel that your email open rates are not performing as per your expectations, you must ask these questions:Is your email subject line standing out?Attractive subject lines make a"

            "content": "In the first three phases of this sales funnel series, we covered the major aspects of acquisition, activation, and retention of the users.The series is created with an aim to scrutinize each stage of the AARRR framework making it more understandable and adaptable for businesses of all sizes.Now in this fourth phase (referral) of the sales funnel series, we will look at how to turn your customers into advocates.Referral \u2013 are they referring you to their networkThe framework consists of all the necessary steps to help you in achieving sustainable revenue growth.If all the steps are followed correctly, you can reach a state where you will witness consistent inflow of new customers, who would be interested in what you offer and stay with you as your loyal customers for an extended period of time.However, to ensure a consistent flow of new customers, you will need a strong strategy like word of mouth through referrals. It is one of the oldest and cost-effective methods to expand your customer base.Referral is when someone refers your product or services to others, who might get interested and take action. They don\u2019t need to be a customer to do the referral, and the action is not necessarily a purchase.Why are referrals so powerful?\u201cNothing influences people more than a recommendation from a trusted friend\u201d \u2013 Mark Zuckerberg. Referral is the best medium to reach new customers.A message conveyed through an advertisement won\u2019t be as impactful as the one passed by a current user. Human referral is more trusted, especially when they are in your networks.92% of people trust recommendations from friends and family over any other type of advertising.Referral between two known people increases the chances of lead conversion.Don\u2019t you purchase a product if you get a good review from your friend? Similarly, people prefer investing in a tried and tested product.Referral often happens spontaneously when a customer is impressed by the features or benefits of a solution, but businesses can also influence it by using the right strategies. Customers referred by other customers have a 37% higher retention rate.Two metrics that needs your attention to referrals are: 1. Net Promoter Score (NPS) \u2013 With NPS score, you can find out how willing users are to recommend your products or services. The score comes from the Net Promoter Score question, which is-\u201cOn a scale of 0 to 10, how likely is that you would recommend our organization to a friend or business associate?\u201dBased on the number the client selects, they are placed into one of the below categories:Score breakdown\n0-6: Detractors (unsatisfied customers who can influence others negatively)\n7-8: Passives (might not recommend but won\u2019t even create a negative image of your product)\n9-10: Promoters (happy customers who fuel growth by spreading positive information about your product) 2. Viral coefficient \u2013 It is the number of new users a current referrer generates. For calculating the viral coefficient of your products or services, you require three numbers:\nnumber of existing users,\nnumber of invitations sent (shares, referral, etc.) and\naverage conversion rate of those invitations.Then multiply those three metrics and divide it by the number of existing users for getting the viral coefficient. Your viral coefficient needs to be more than one to experience growth.Prerequisites for referralTo get more referral customers, you need to keep your existing clients happy. They can save you from the tiresome task of hunting new prospects.Besides a referred customer\u2019s lifetime value is 16% higher when compared to non-referred customers. Positive word of mouth is the best, but sometimes negative word of mouth can spread like wildfire.So, make sure they share anything wrong about their experience with you first before sharing with someone else.Be cautious about the below point as they can create a negative impression on your customers:\nLong wait time \u2013 as per a survey, 41% of customers expect a response from the support team within six hours, but only 36% of businesses responded within that time frame.\nToo many follow-up emails.\nPoor product performance (missing features, fewer benefits, etc.).\nMade a commitment and didn\u2019t fulfill it.\nBeing transferred from one sales rep/support agent to another \u2013 as per a study that asked customers what annoyed them the most, saw 37% of respondents mentioning \u201cbeing passed around\u201d.\nComplex website layout \u2013 researchers asked participants in an eye-tracking study to use a website to locate the USA\u2019s current population, and 87% of them failed to find it even when it was presented in large red numbersDon\u2019t give them a reason to speak anything negative about you. Find the glitches in your solution and fix it in real-time.Technologies can help you in identifying the problem. Using the right software, you can track emails you sent and listen to the conversation you had during the buying process to discover the problematic areas.Ensure you build a consistent custome"

User Retention is the third phase of the sales funnel series.This series is created with an aim to scrutinize each stage of the AARRR framework making it more understandable and adaptable for businesses of all sizes.User retentionIt isn\u2019t enough to attract new users and give them reasons to use the product.For steady business growth, you need to hold them for a long time by creating a long-term relationship.In fact, it costs more to acquire a new customer. 70% companies say it\u2019s cheaper to retain a customer than acquire a new one.Going through the same process all over again is a cumbersome task. Besides, it\u2019s time-consuming; why not put in efforts on the customers who already know your product.As per a research, increasing customer retention rates by 5% increases profits by 25%.Would you purchase a new car if the one that you bought a year back isn\u2019t working?Any sensible person would try to fix it, rather than investing in a new one.Similarly, work on your retention strategies for reducing churn instead of hunting for new customers.55% of SaaS companies rate customer retention cost as the key metric to measure.Proactive customer retention is especially crucial for a SaaS company, as users won\u2019t take time to unsubscribe and turn towards the competitors if they are not getting the desired results.Like, if you are disappointed with the streaming content of Hulu, you will instantly switch to Netflix. As it has the best collection of movies and it also streams a complete series unlike Hulu that only offers a selected number of episodes from any given series.\u201cA satisfied customer is the best business strategy of all\u201d- Michael LebouefGetting to the root of a problemYes, you are not immune to your competition. There are chances that your current customer might get tempted to try a similar product.However, that doesn\u2019t mean you give up on them and ignore your competition. The key is to understand and solve the problem.Similarly, for retaining more users and reducing churn, you need to dig deeper and find out where is your product lacking.\nWhy are your customers choosing your competitors over you?\nWhat more features or benefits are your competitors offering?For that, you need to have a good understanding of your product.\nWhat are your strengths and weaknesses?\nWhat is the average time a user spends with your product before unsubscribing?Fill the gaps in your relationship with the customers and work on powering your product by analyzing your retention metrics.Tracking and measuring retention metrics can help you in understanding where do you need to focus your attention on optimizing your product.Below are some of the main retention metrics that you need to consider:1. Customer churn rateThe percentage of customers or subscribers who cut ties with your company or service over a period. It is perhaps the point of reference when we talk about retention.Calculation formula: (Number of customers at the start of the year- number of customers at the end of the year)/ Number of customers at the start of the year2. Revenue churn rateIt is the percentage of revenue you have lost from existing customers in a given period.Calculation formula: Monthly Revenue Churn Rate = [(MRR at Start of Month \u2013 MRR at End of Month) \u2013 MRR in Upgrades during Month]/ MRR at the start of Month3. Repeat purchase rateIt is the percentage of loyal and satisfied customers you have onboard who keeps purchasing from you.Calculation formula: Repeat Purchase Rate = Number of Returning Customers / Number of Total Customers4. Net promoter scoreFrom a scale of 0 to 10, how likely are you to recommend this product to your networks? The answer to this question is your net promoter score.The customers who rate you 9 or 10 are your promoters and those rating you below 6 are the ones that need your attention as they might leave you anytime soon.Calculation formula: Net Promoter Score = % of Promoters \u2013 % of Detractors5. Redemption rateCoupons with special offers and discounts is an effective strategy to bring a customer back. But how many of them are redeemed?Find it out by calculating the redemption rate that tells whether your customers are purchasing or not when a coupon is issued.Calculation formula: Redemption rate= Number of coupons redeemed/ Number of coupons issuedTactics to growth hack retentionRetention is the most crucial aspect of the sales funnel. Hacking retention can positively impact your business revenue if done correctly.An increase in retention can augment the lifetime value of the customer.

However, there is always a way to get things done. Before getting to that, we need first to understand the reason for creating a survey and the ways to develop it.Reasons why you should do a customer surveyHere are four reasons why you need to bother about creating customer survey forms for your customers:Reason 1- Improve customer satisfactionFor rendering utmost customer satisfaction, you need to understand your customer\u2019s preferences. A customer survey will help you in finding out what they like or dislike about your product. By collecting such feedback, you will know what you need to do to keep your customers happy.Reason 2- Stimulate discussionDiscuss important topics of the survey with your customers. Give them a chance to elaborate on their views. You will not only get a broader perspective of your survey but also gain the client\u2019s trust and loyalty.They will feel good that you are genuinely interested in knowing how they feel about your products or services.Reason 3- Determine product or service performanceUse the customer survey to improve the performance of your service or product. A little tweak and improvement can help in capturing the attention of more customers.For that, you need to know what\u2019s not working. So, ask product-specific questions to improve and offer an impactful product to your customers.Reason 4- Figure out what matters the mostThere are disconnects between what customers want and what companies think customers want. A survey can give you more clarity and help you in staying on the right track.So, based on the survey answers you can plan your strategy to provide what the customer really wants.After understanding the reasons for surveying your clients, your next step should be to define your goals.Like, write down-What is the purpose of creating a customer survey?What are you exactly trying to figure out?Who do you want to send the survey to? (you can bifurcate the customer by demographics, business size and annual revenue)Which medium will you use to conduct the survey? (Like through social media or survey platforms like SurveyMonkey, SurveyAnyplace, and SurveyGizmo)What are you going to do with the data collected from the survey?Once your goals are defined, it is time to write the survey.Ways to create a customer survey that worksA survey form can help in measuring the success of your product. Below are a few ways to create an impactful survey that will help you in gathering the necessary information you need to improve your product.1. Keep it shortEnsure your surveys are short and precise. No one has time to answer lengthy surveys. So, eliminate unnecessary questions and avoid using superfluous phrases in your questions. Every question should have a strong reason for being in your survey.2. Create open-ended questionsMultiple choice questions or polar questions might seem appealing, but they aren\u2019t able to collect enough information. Open-ended questions give customers more freedom and space to share their opinion about your product or services.3. Use customer survey templatesThe survey can be time-consuming, so it is better to use the premade templates offered by various survey platforms and edit it to suit your needs. You can even reuse your work, by saving the survey you created as a template and customizing it as per the current requirements.4. Format it correctlyAvoid confusion and keep your survey focused by grouping similar kind of questions. Create sections and title it to bifurcate these groups. Provide guidelines and instructions to the customers, so they don\u2019t face any trouble while answering the questions.5. Be clear and specificEnsure your question aren\u2019t vague or general. The customer will leave the survey if they aren\u2019t able to understand your question. Be straightforward and specific while creating questions. Explain everything that could be interpreted in more than one way.6. Review your surveyGive your survey one last look before sending it to the customer to avoid any mistakes as it might affect your company\u2019s reputation. To be on a safer side, even ask someone else to review the survey to ensure you haven\u2019t missed any critical point.7. Use toolsThere are many tools available to build your survey forms like Survey Monkey and Formstack. With the aid of these high-end tools, you can easily create your online survey without any"

            "title": "7 Tips for hiring the best salespeople",
            "content": "Successful sales strategies help companies stay afloat. Better the sales number, the more you increase your company\u2019s lifespan in the market. Every business owner will agree to the fact that they need top salespeople in their organization for those sales strategies.Searching for talented sales representatives is a crucial and frustrating quest because you need sales professionals who will keep pushing forward so that you can move your business to the next level, without breaking your spine.Here are a few simple tips that might come in handy in your quest of hiring the best salespeople for your organization:1. Be on the lookout for someone who has industry expertiseThe process of getting someone new onboard and train them is a time-consuming task. Time is of immense importance for every business owner. This pushes the fact forward that you must lookout for someone who has the right industry expertise.Sometimes your products play a crucial part too\nWhile it is easier for salespeople to quickly learn about some products and start their sales pitch to prospects, some products need in-depth knowledge before the sales pitches can start.Salespeople belonging to your industry will quickly understand the sales dynamics which will smoothen the process of making sales using the trade-tricks they have learned.Lack of industry experience is not a deal-breaker; however, an ideal sales candidate must have some experience close to the same background.2. Must have a high sales IQThis statement is not to demotivate the sales fraternity, but it is imperative for businesses to hire salespeople who have a high sales IQ for doing the job in the manner you want them to.\nTo excel at their job, i.e., sales, salespeople must have a particular skill set.Many of the skills can be taught like creating a conversation with a prospect or writing attractive cold emails or proposals.But some skills are just inherent.For a successfully running tenure for your business, you will need to hire people who have a natural knack for building lasting relationships with their prospects.An elevated level of emotional intelligence is also part of the skill set you must look for in a sales candidate.Another essential skill is of quickly reading people and picking up a conversation at the correct time. They should also be great listeners.High performing salespeople are the ones who understand what the prospects and customers want from producers.The most important skill that your candidate must have is that they need to be highly persuasive.If they can\u2019t close a deal, they are not contributing to your company\u2019s goal of staying afloat in the market.3. Understand the needs for your latest sales hireKnowing the why behind your hiring requirement also plays a significant role for you.You might be hiring X number of salespeople because you are on the road to success or you have not found the correct mix of people with ample sales skills.4. A clutter-free Sales Hire BudgetYou know that the next step for you now is to put up a job description to look for your requirements.\nReview your current business needs and assess any experience gap that is present in your sales department.Cross-check the skill set you are looking for against the experience level you need.Create an affordable budget so that you can match it with the salary that you plan to offer your sales hire.When you\u2019re in a start-up, the first ten people will determine whether the company succeeds or not. Each is 10 percent of the company. So why wouldn\u2019t you take as much time as necessary to find all the A players? If three were not so great, why would you want a company where 30 percent of your people are not so great? A small company depends on great people much more than a big company does. \u2013 Steve Jobs5. Reach out to the right candidatesIn the hiring process for the best salespeople, you must understand that they are always elusive in saying yes to businesses.\nMany online portals help small and mid-sized businesses in searching for the ideal sales candidate.Many candidates in these portals are not looking for a change, but they will sway with a perfectly persuasive and personalized appeal.Generate enough interest for the ones that you think are the ones for your organization that they take time to think over your offer.While these more passive candidates may not be crawling the web for their next job, with a compelling and personalized pitch, you may be able to generate interest in what your company has to offer.For the active candidates, personalize your offer emails with a message that focuses on the opportunities. Also, let them know the reasons why you think they are a perfect fit for your organization.6. Develop a clear interview processWith a structured interview process, the chances of finding the correct person for your sales requirement becomes easier. Every business is different and has its own set of unique needs.We are listing down the standard practice for conducting interviews:\nAn info"

            "content": "A sales funnel is crucial for every business to improve conversion and increase revenue. It helps marketing and sales professionals in understanding the buyer\u2019s journey from the initial awareness stage to the final decision stage.What is a sales funnel?A sales funnel is a customer-focused sales model that displays the buyer\u2019s journey from the initial contact to the final conversion.A well-designed sales funnel can simplify the sales process and help you in identifying risks in real-time. It is a smart way of taking the major moves towards fulfilling your sales goals.You can determine prospects\u2019 requirements and know what you need to do for converting them into paying customers.The width of each section of the sales funnel reflects the number of opportunities, the top being the widest and the bottom being the narrowest.Benefits of using sales funnel:Makes your sales more consistentIt helps you in nurturing leadsIt delivers better sales estimateIt aids in sorting and prioritizing high potential prospectsTo measure the effectiveness of the sales funnel and achieving success at each stage of sales funnel, Dave McClure introduced the AARRR framework a.k.a Pirate Metrics.Dave is a venture capitalist and founder of startup accelerator, 500 startups \u2013  Originally designed for startups. This framework has also proven to be beneficial for established enterprises.This sales funnel series is created with an aim to understand each stage of the AARRR framework for businesses of all sizes.The sales funnel is divided into five Stages- Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Referral, and Revenue.Let us commence by throwing light on the first stage of the sales funnel framework:Phase 1- AcquisitionBeing the first contact point for customers, Acquisition is one of the most important stages of the Pirate Metrics. As Pierre Lechelle points out correctly in his article:To ensure that customers go through the funnel stages (to Revenue), you have to make sure that there are enough customers at the top of the funnel. Without those customers, there will be no customers at the end.Volume matters but the quality of the leads is equally valuable. For achieving the desired sales results, it is necessary to attract the right audience.There is a simple explanation for Acquisition: Users hear about you and land on your site from different channels. It doesn\u2019t stand merely for that though; it also refers to the users\u2019 first impression of your product.Along with measuring how many people you acquire in a given time, you will also have to measure how many of them subscribed for a free trial. Also how many got converted into paying customers.There are several acquisition channels; you need to track and find out which one is best in terms of volume, price, and quality.This will help you in understanding where you need to place a greater focus on optimizing exposure and engagement.Example: You are running a handbag brand, and your target audience spends their maximum time on Instagram and Facebook.Instead of wasting time on Twitter or creating long videos on YouTube, you should try posting on Instagram and Facebook using engaging campaigns.For instance, Lululemon, a yoga, and sports apparel company from Canada. The brand used Instagram to bring more users on board by posting impressive yoga poses and preaching inspirational wisdom.According to\u00a0Simply Measured, Lululemon doesn\u2019t post every day, still, its Instagram results are phenomenal. Their account has an average of 9.4% engagement rate, more than 27,000 likes and 250 comments per photo.Instead of casting your net wide, spend your budget and efforts on only a few channels that are effective.The acquisition logic you must followThe few things that you need to keep in mind-Market your product efficiently by identifying the right channel and personaMeasure each step of your sales funnelTest various channels and eliminate the ones that don\u2019t workEmphasize on channel segmentation and the type of customers you acquireLet\u2019s assume you have designed a product that makes a certain process/task easier. Customers would like it and willing to pay for it. However, the challenge is to identify the acquisition channel for bringing in those buyers.For this, you need to create an impactful strategy from scratch. Research and explore various tactics then start experimenting with each to see which one works the best.Acquisition techniques you should start testingOver the years, companies have tried a wide spectrum of techniques to attract the ideal prospect. The acquisition techniques differ per industry.SaaS and e-commerce companies might use the same technique, but their approaches will be different. One focuses on acquiring business while the other on the customer.Before moving to the techniques, it would be wiser to look at some statistics that provide major lead generation insights:64% of B2B marketers generate leads via LinkedIn, 49% via Facebook, and 36% via Twitter.67% of B2B marketers say their primary go"

            "content": "Yes, you made your idea into a product or service, and now, you are eager to go.But, go where?Even when you have a target customer base acquiring your first few customers is a challenging task.Why?Because neither you nor the customers yet know if your solution holds some value for them or not.The same fact goes for startup owners; you will not get the actual valuation (total worth) of your product or service until you start selling at your full capacity.So, how can you be \u201cNil Payment\u201d to \u201cfirst 100 paying customers\u201d?For achieving that, studying how previous startups have done it becomes essential for new startups.After doing our research here is what we understood.Using a single channel for bringing numerous users.You must rely on different channels and sources as it allows you to build a more significant number of the user base.Not everyone is born a salesperson or entrepreneur.Why the comparison?Well, aren\u2019t you selling your product and services to the general public?Aren\u2019t you looking for better businesses and investors for your future course of action?In this article, we will not be talking about any superficial strategy for getting your first 100 customers.On the contrary, we will be highlighting some points that might be at the back of your mind.After reading this article, you will be sure that what you were thinking was a nice set of workable plans.1. Utilize existing network: Ask friends to ask their friends and so onThe place to start out is by rattling your inner circle.Yes, while you are looking for your initial customers, the first step is talking to the people who know you.When you are starting out as an organization, it is easy for you to feel the hesitation of approaching new people with your solution be it a product or a service!\nFriends, family, and your professional connections are all part of your internal network\nAsk your inner circle to be your customers\nThen ask them to recommend their connectionsBased on their experience with your solution it becomes comfortable to approach mutual connections for startups.You might be asking yourself, \u201care these numbers of people enough?\u201dWe want to clarify, although the number of connections you make via your inner circle might be less, you are guaranteed to find quite a respectable number for the initial outing.How can you execute this?\nAsk them about their pain points.\nListen to what they want to say.Based on your conversation with them validate your idea of how the solution is going to help them and people who have the same pain points.Don\u2019t decide on selling your solution to them or others right away.Being a startup, getting customer feedback at an early stage allows you to tinker with the final solution that you want to sell in the market.Why is it essential for you to create a conversation with your inner circle?The conversation that you have with your inner circle is not just for researching their pain points and creating your first customer base.\nAs you are a startup, it may be possible that you lack the skill of a smooth-talking salesman.\nOnce you try your hand at selling your solution in your inner circle, it provides you with the first-hand experience of pitching your business.Note: In this early stage, you are developing your base. You are in the crucial process of customer development where you are not supposed to sell but learn!2. Take the cold approachNow that you have learned the first step of growing your business, you will start approaching various potential customers.The usual round of pitching your services or products to them.This is where cold calls and cold emails come in handy for businesses.\nThe practice of reaching out to the potential customers fitting the target-customer profile via strategic emails is called cold emailing.\nThe aim of cold emailing is to let potential buyers know about the existence of your business and the solution it can provide to them.\nHowever, the success of your cold email outreach relies on the fact that you must have some of the other mutual connections whom you can use to introduce yourself.\nUnbelievably, if your opening lines talk about the recommendation of a mutual connection, then the recipient will take more interest in your email.If you lack this edge, then we will suggest that you must take more time in researching the same as it makes your approach more personal with a higher success ratio.You want to grab the attention of your user so that they do open and read the content of your cold email?Then keep in mind that your subject line must be.Use a straightforward subject line so that you do not sound like a person who is trying to pitch sales to a potential customer.\nYou now have an approach and a catchy subject line. Make an impression on your recipient by providing value in the opening lines of your email.\nWhen you provide the \u201cCore\u201d in your email.\nIt helps you leverage the goodwill as the reader realizes that you have created something that will help them have their desired ROI.\nThis wil"

            "content": "Being in the world of sales you all are familiar with various pricing questions asked by your prospects.Various pricing questions cross your mind when you face such circumstances.\nWhat is the most intriguing fact behind the question that your prospects asked?\nWhy do they mention the expensive part of your product and service without considering the fact that it is going to solve their problems they have been facing until now?\nIs the question asked because your prospects are bound by low-budget?\nOr do they lack in apt knowledge of the market?\nOr the standard features are missing from our product and service which the customers notice and compare your price with that of the competitors?If you have read till this part, then we are sure you have been troubled with the pricing questions.In this article, will teach you the art of responding to pricing questions.However, if you want an answer to the question, then you must understand\nwhy price hits the psyche of your prospects?\nwhy it hinders a crucial deal from timely closure?Biggest pricing question,\u201dWhat\u2019s price tag?\u201dYou called up your prospect after they have shown interest in your services.While explaining the services to them, you are cut short by the prospect.He asks you his first pricing question.\nYou are baffled because you do not know how you should respond to him?\nIf you quote too high, they get the chance to get you off the phone.\nBut if you quote something low from the standard company price, your manager is going to be really angry with you.\nThis catch-22 situation sometimes does lead to miscommunication related to price and various other related deals.As we said earlier, this is a tricky situation, and you are clueless about your apt reply at this stage.So, let\u2019s understand why such questions are asked to sales professionals and how you can respond!Q.1 \u201cWill Your price fit my Budget?\u201dYour prospects range from millennials to CEO\u2019s, and the budget is the \u201cconstant\u201d that triggers the buying decision in everyone.Budget is a critical factor in such scenarios.You have to find out if the prospect lacks the budget for initial investment or the price is too high for the longer term?For businesses, initial investment may seem too high, and an easy payment plan makes them nod for the price quickly.Another issue that is related to budget is the value of the product that the prospect doesn\u2019t see against the price.Response\nIn such cases, be upfront and ask the prospect when will your services become feasible for their budget and reach out to them at that time.\nWith proper consultation with the higher authorities, an exclusive deal can be designed to meet their budget if they are going to provide future business and recommendations.\nYou can also make certain cuts in the features they do not require and pay only for the ones they want to use.\nIn this case, you make it feasible for them to use your services.\nAs a sales representative, you have to be persuasive but not forceful in explaining to them how your solution is an investment in their company\u2019s future.\nMake them realize that it is not like spending their budget on office furniture and in turn holds actual ROI.\nProvide them with a dollar amount that makes your deal a lot more tangible, this way the prospect can see the value that is related to your services.The next stage of pricing question is the comparison between the prices of your competition.Q.2 \u201cWhy is your competitors\u2019 Price lower/ higher?\u201dBut, compared to what?Expensive is a term that is relatable to every sales professional.Prospects must realize how valuable your product is.Knowing and understanding this helps you plan the terms of negotiation with the prospect while successfully closing deals.Response\nIf your prospect is placing his buying decision on price comparison with your competitors, then do your comparison homework too.\nYou can do so by comparing the features that your solution provides against the price and reassure your prospects about the added value that comes with a higher price tag.\nSometimes their buying decision gets swayed not because of the features, but with the warranty or post-sales support, they will receive if they chose your brand.\nIf your services have any kind of competitive advantage over your competitors, make sure that your prospect is aware of them.Q.3 \u201cYour Service Misses some features!\u201dSometimes, while making comparisons, the prospect notices that your services lack some features that your competitor offers?ResponseFind deal breakers or a negotiation tactic for the buyer.\nHighlight and focus on the features that your brand is offering, and others aren\u2019t.\nReason with your prospect that even though we lack in the X feature, it doesn\u2019t make a lot of difference because the Y feature makes it up for the absence.\nMake them believe that your Y feature adds more value to their purchase than the lack of X feature.\nIf you have been inquired about the absence of more than one prospect and the number

            "content": "So, the fiscal year was just wrapped up and for people who have been holding their plans to launch their startups, this will be an apt time to carry them out.We would like to ask a question though; is it easy to launch a startup?We are not doubting your capability or your vision or the idea you have been shaping till now.We know that your vision regarding your startup is strong.You have imagined your product successfully selling on Amazon, Walmart and have also practiced the presentation while giving interviews explaining your competitive edge.Where do you start for your startup launch?The first 90 days are the crucial time in your business\u2019s life.Getting your early steps right helps you create a sound foundation for a profitable, growing business.Some questions that must cloud your mind while you plan the launch of your startup are:\nDo I set up Google Analytics for my website?\nIs my website showing up in search engine results?\nAm I correctly tracking business expenses?\nHave I set up social media accounts?\nDo I have a mailing list?\nIs my data regularly getting backed up?These questions will not help you earn, well, not directly.However, having such information with you makes it easier to calculate the loss or expense that will go into burning the cash to keep your startup afloat, till suitable ROI is achieved.If you are hoping to become a profitable startup, then you must hurry up its launch.The number of tasks is more crucial than the type of tasks entrepreneurs do in the early stage of the launch according to the Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics.Entrepreneurs who implement startup activities faster are more likely to see profits,\u201d says Paul Reynolds, coordinating principal investigator of the Panel StudyYour startup launch activities can be divided into two categories\nThe first is the open-minded discovery. Be it finance, customers or go-to-market strategies, entrepreneurs base it all on assumptions.\nThe only thing that they know or are certain about is their strengths. Such an experimental approach is generally found at the core of Lean Startup.\nYou might say that Lean Startup backs up \u201ceffectual entrepreneurship,\u201d which is a research-based approach where improvisation takes the driving seat when a startup is launched.Social entrepreneurship is the use of startup companies and other entrepreneurs to develop, fund and implement solutions to social, cultural, or environmental issues. \u2013 Wikipedia\nSocial entrepreneurship is the second type of startup activity.\nWe are not saying that you have not lived with your startup idea for a long time.\nAnd now while launching your dream, you must not get way over your head.\nIt may sound like we are preaching meditation, but you must stay calm and think about certain aspects of your venture.\nYou must figure out you the target market upon which you will base your revenue and your resource capacity.Now, how can an entrepreneur build its brand around professional and personal acquaintance?You will require a fundamental amount of inputs from your\npartners,\nadvisers,\npotential customers.For any entrepreneur, having such constructive interactions with your entrepreneurial environment helps in bringing new perspectives to your enterprise; that\u2019s networking for you.Startup launch checklistWorking with startups and entrepreneurs, we have enlisted some crucial checklists here that will come in handy for you in launching a successful startup.1. Know your customers \u2013 walk in your customers\u2019 shoesThe idea behind minimum viable product is to get your offering as quickly as possible into the hands of customers to generate feedback. You must make sure you are solving the right problem. Market data and surveys don\u2019t tell you that. You must\u00a0get close to the customer experience\u00a0possible for those crucial insights. Doing so before you commit to a solution saves lot of frustration.  \u2013 Leigh Buchanan\nKnow your customer.\u00a0Just knowing does not suffice, you must find out about their wants, their profession, and how they feel about their profession.\nYou must engage with the customers daily routine be it their life or work.\nThis insight creates a master-apprentice relationship; and mind this, you are the apprentice!\nYou must ask them (customers) to let you observe them.\nAsk open-ended questions about the experience and workflow.Why is that necessary?Well, we are not asking you to do this by giving them your sympathy, however, keeping up with this practice helps you empathize with their life.If you do not understand their daily grind, how are you going to improve their life with your product or service?This process also provides a practical understanding of their pain points and adds an emotional context, letting you see things through your prospects eyes.Interviewing them isn\u2019t good enough.Being monotonous in some cases leaves people blind, leaving out the vital parts of their daily descriptions.2.

            "content": "Selling without a sales plan is like traveling without an itinerary, you do not know where you want to go and what you want to do.You end up wasting your time, money and resources.Planning and strategizing are the two prerequisites to stay on track.For instance, when you are exhibiting at a tradeshow, you cannot just go and stand behind a booth without any preparation.You will have to plan and build strategies before the exhibition, to attract traffic to your booth.Which includes \u2013\nideating how to present the booth\ncreating banner standee to increase the visibility of your company\nprinting brochures to acquaint the visitors with your product\ncustomizing giveaways to spread awareness about your existence in the industrySimilarly, to succeed in sales, you need to develop the route to success with a \u2018Sales plan\u2019.Creating a sales plan appears as a daunting task, but it is worth the efforts.\u201cEvery minute you spend in planning saves you 10 minutes in execution; this gives you a 1000 percent return on energy\u201d- Brian TracyMoreover, with a sales template, you can quickly create your sales plan.To help you, below I have created a sales plan template and provided few samples that you can refer while creating your sales plan.Before getting to the templates, let\u2019s drill deeper into the concept of sales plan and understand its importance.Sales plan\u201cOur goals can only be reached through a vehicle of plan, in which we must fervently believe, and upon which we must vigorously act. There is no other route to success\u201d- Pablo Picasso The sales plan is an approach to selling that helps in setting objectives and determining strategies to achieve them.It contains the evaluation of the past sales and prepares you to achieve better sales results in the future.Sales plan aids in identifying new sales market, acquaints everyone with their responsibilities and helps in creating a timeline to reach the milestone.Why is sales planning important?Success cannot be achieved with random actions; you need a strategic sales plan to move in the right direction.Sales Plan-\nAids in acquiring new customers and retaining the existing ones\nHelps in streamlining your sales efforts\nProvides a direction to reach your goals\nAids in identifying the target audience\nGives you control over the sales cycle\nRenders insights into consumer behavior\nAids in spotting and addressing risks\nKeeps you aligned with your sales objectivesSales plan template layoutBelow is a sales plan template that will help you in understanding the points that you need to include in your sales plan.Section one- Objectives\u201cSetting goals is the first step in turning the invisible into the visible\u201d- Tony RobbinsHere you need to define the goals for your sales team that they need to achieve in a stipulated time frame.A clear objective helps in keeping your sales team focused.For example \u2013 A digital printing machinery company intend to increase their market share.For this, they will have to tap into the new geographic market to increase their visibility.So, tapping into a new market becomes their sales planning objective.The goals you set, need to be realistic. You can\u2019t expect a sales rep to close ten deals in one month.When 10%\u201320% of salespeople miss goals, the problem might be the salespeople.But when most salespeople miss, the problem is their goals.Only when the objective is clear, you can create the plan of action to achieve it.Section Two- Current scenario and obstaclesIn this section, you need to assess your past as well as current sales performance and identify the obstacles that are hindering your growth.Try to understand what\u2019s not working and where do you need to put in extra efforts.Only when you are aware of your problems, you will be able to search for a solution to resolve it.Using various reporting tools, find out answers to various questions like:\nWhat were your sales target for last month/quarter and did you achieve it?\nWhat is the average length of your sales cycle?\nHow many deals were in your sales pipeline last month/quarter and how many did you convert?\nHow effective are your outbound activities?\nIn which stage of the sales process do you lose prospect?Once you answer these question, you need to ponder over the reasons for the areas where you couldn\u2019t perform well.Example: If your sales pipeline had 15 deals but you could convert only six deals, then try to find out the reason for losing nine deals.\nWas it the price factor?\nDid you discuss their budget too late?\nWere you not able to solve their problem?\nWere you self-oriented?\nDid you fail in displaying the value of your product?Section Three- Target AudienceFocus on identifying your target audience, communicating an authentic message that they want and need and project yourself as an \u201cexpert\u201d within your niche- Kim GarstIn this section, you need to identify your ideal customer.Conduct thorough research to find the right target audience who can invest in your product.Knowing whom to approach and whom to ignore, can "

Create a lead processBusinesses survive and excel based on the workflow they decide for their daily process.In that same manner, you must create a workflow.It must define the point at which a lead is generated until it is handed off to sales from marketing.A proper textbook approach is sometimes beneficial for B2B companies.Inquiry Generated \u2192 MQL (marketing qualified lead) \u2192 SAO (sales accepted opportunity) \u2192 SQO (sales qualified opportunity) \u2192 Deal Status (Closed/Won deal)You can later evolve this process depending on the campaign feedback sales receives in the future.Step 2. Clearly define the Lead Handover ProcessA half-baked cake is equal to a half-convinced prospect.It becomes crucial for you to define and decide when a lead must be handed over to sales.Include information like\nCompany size\nDesignation\nIndustry\nBehavioral information (content requested by lead, whether demo has been requested)Determine the lead hand-off process\nDefine which leads are ready to be handed to sales\nhow sales must follow up on these leads\nmaking sure that the demanding work of marketing doesn\u2019t get blown\nDevelop a workable Service Level Agreements (SLA"

            "title": "Four effective tips to get the best out of your sales team",
            "content": "Sales managers are a powerful force when they have a strong team, without them, it would be challenging to score winning goals.All fingers are not the same; similarly, your sales team is a conglomeration of different individuals with unique traits and abilities.Some might be performing exceptionally well, while others might be slow learners with unexplored capabilities.As a sales honcho, it is your responsibility to up their game and get the most out of your sales team.You need to identify their hidden potentials and attributes.Find out the secrets of the top performers and try to understand where the underachievers are facing problems.Show your underachiever the way to get out of the slump and encourage your top performers to climb higher.Don\u2019t forget, better performance means more sales and increased revenue.Here are four effective tips that will help you in bringing the best out of your sales team:1.Create and maintain a growth mindsetSale success begins with the sales professional\u2019s mindset.No matter how your sales reps are performing there is always a scope for improvement with a growth-oriented mindset.With little efforts, the abilities can be improved.However, some sales professionals are stuck with a victim mentality; they are not able to discover, learn and grow.These sales reps feel that they cannot break the vicious cycle of poor performance.They avoid new challenges and are unable to deal with rejections.They start pitying themselves and are filled with negativity.John. W. Gardner rightly said, \u201cSelf-pity is easily the most destructive of the non-pharmaceutical narcotics; it is addictive, gives momentary pleasure and separates the victim from reality.\u201dAs the head of the team, you need to change this mindset and help them in getting better.Teach them to look at challenges as an opportunity.Encourage them to believe in themselves and guide them to outstretch their capabilities.Being in the driver\u2019s seat, you need to lead your team in a positive direction and help them in developing a growth mindset.Praise their hard work and encourage them to work better.2.Create healthy competitionTapping the competitive spirit is the smart way to bring the best out of your sales team.Competition pushes them out of their limitations and helps them in performing better.Give them a chance to explore their unexplored capabilities.\u201cA horse never runs so fast as when he has other horses to catch up and outpace.\u201d- OvidThe strive for winning can unveil the true potential of your sales reps.Everyone wants to win, get applauds and hear praises.So, create the environment of competition by clearly defining the competition\u2019s objective with a clear set of rules.Publicize the results to drive individual competition.\u201cCompetition is always a good thing. It forces us to do our best. A monopoly renders people complacent and satisfied with mediocrity\u201d \u2013 Nancy PearceyHowever, you need to ensure that the competition doesn\u2019t turn ugly; they shouldn\u2019t start snatching each other\u2019s lead to be the frontrunner.Use technology like CRM, to maintain transparency within the team.With a CRM, everyone in the team can see who is working on which deal and where are they, and their prospects in the buying cycle.It avoids conflict and helps them in improving their sales performance.3.Keep motivatingPressure, criticism, and rejections surround sales professionals.As the head of the team, you need to motivate them to keep their morale high for dealing with such stressful situations.They should feel energized and positive at the start of each day.Instead of yelling at them when they do not achieve their targets, discuss with them and try to find out the reasons.Analyze the past sales data with the help of a reporting tool to find out the hidden barriers to performance.Give them the solutions to deal with the issues and encourage them to work better.These sales reps can perform exceptionally well as selling is their forte; all they need is the right direction to display their capabilities.Acknowledge them when they are performing well and celebrate their success.Choose your words wisely while acknowledging the work of your best performers.As words have great impact; they can motivate the person to perform much better next time.Instead of just saying \u201cGood job\u201d try to be more specific \u201cour recent numbers are impressive, it was a commendable performance. I appreciate the hard work you put into understanding and convincing the client. Keep up the good work\u201d Hearing such words in public gives them a reason to work harder and maximize their potential.4.Emphasize on learning opportunitiesYour job doesn\u2019t end with just the initial training when a new rep is hired. Keep sharing tactics and strategies to help them excel.Conduct weekly or monthly meetings to evaluate your sales rep\u2019s performance and check if they are using the right sales methodology.Explain what more can they do to convert a deal quickly.\u201cAs a leader, how do you get the most out of your people?

            "title": "Sales tips for SaaS companies to increase conversions",
            "content": "With the increasing popularity of the SaaS products, the competition is also proliferating with great pace in the industry.Just building an excellent product or offering free trials and discounts is not sufficient to expand your profit margins.It is pointless if the trial users of your SaaS-based product are not converting into actual customers.There are many points you need to consider beyond the discounts and free trials to achieve the desired sales results.Here are few sales tips that will help you in boosting your conversions:1. Personalize your sales callsEnsure you are well acquainted with the prospect\u2019s requirements and company before you contact them.Calling and presenting the brighter picture of your product will just be a waste of time.Prospects who opted for a free trial must have got an idea of your product and they wouldn\u2019t like to hear the same information all over again.So instead of calling and speaking about the excellent features of your products, try to-\nDiscuss about the business challenges they are facing and how will your SaaS product help them in overcoming these challenges.\nDrill deeper into the benefit that the prospect will receive on using your product.\nDifferentiate yourself from the competitors by highlighting the distinctive functionalities.For discussing about their pain points, you will need to know them first.For which you will have to garner information about them and maintain it systematically for easy reference.A CRM solution can help you in doing that.With a SaaS CRM, you can seamlessly streamline the contacts and the information related to it.Connecting with prospects gets easier when the information you need is easily available to access when you need it.2. Don\u2019t wait, call your trial signups immediatelyAs a SaaS company, you need to be alert about opportunities and react instantaneously.One such opportunity is when someone signs up for a free trial. Most of the SaaS companies wait until the trial period ends to contact the prospects.The first few days after the signup are crucial as the prospect is trying to understand the functionalities of your product.This is the right time to connect and show them the true value of your solution.Help them leverage the benefits while they are using your product to understand it better.3. Keep the trial period as short as possible30 days trial period is a standard time frame followed by most of the SaaS companies in the industry. But why follow the crowd?Your product might not be that complex; it can be understood in 10 to 15 days. So, set your free trial period accordingly.When people know there is less time they take more interest in understanding the product as soon as possible to find its benefits.4. Follow up without failProspects need to be chased; they don\u2019t have time for you nor do they remember your product.You need to remind them you exist that too without annoying them.Active follow-up conveys a message that you are interested in working with the prospect.Being consistent doesn\u2019t mean getting on their nerves by nudging them constantly.Things you need to consider while following up:\nGive them time to think by keeping proper gaps between your follow-ups.\nThe gaps shouldn\u2019t be too long that they might forget your product.\nProvide value through follow up by focusing on their needs instead of yours.\nDon\u2019t give up if they don\u2019t seem positive.Nowadays, there are many smart sales tools available in the market that aids in managing your sales deals by reminding you about follow-ups and meetings.Using such tools, you can set reminders and schedule emails to ensure you reach the prospect at the right time.With these smart technologies, you can not only schedule emails but even track your sales emails to find of out if they are being read or ignored.5. Use short demosWhile giving demos, most of the sales reps feel \u201cthe more, the better\u201d.Well not really, you don\u2019t need to specify each minute detail about your SaaS product.By doing that you are just turning a demo into a boring training session.Be precise and display what\u2019s necessary for the prospect.Don\u2019t take more than 20 minutes to demonstrate how your product can solve their problem.Make the demo interactive by asking questions where necessary to ensure they understand your product.Demos can help you win a deal if you present it smartly.6. Analyze your past sales before you proceedPondering over your past sales is important to move forward successfully.Analyzing your historical sales data by creating detailed reports can help in identifying levers that needs to be pulled to yield fruitful results in the future.Such sales insights help in determining trends and understanding reasons for low conversions.You can figure out what\u2019s not working and know which aspect of your software or service needs to be upgraded for improving your sales results.7.

We want to point out that if businesses want to drive innovation and stand out from the competitive crowd, they should never opt for stand-alone systems.\nDo you want to offer a unique experience to your customers?\nIs boosting system efficiency part of your business growth plan?If your answer is yes, then, you must opt for data sharing between CRM, ERP and E-Commerce systems. However, very few businesses engage in system integration; mainly because the process is complicated and risky.\nBringing data together from various sources and systems leads to chaos.\nThis causes extensive delays and frequent budget overruns.\nMoreover, sometimes the most dreaded possibility, loss of data and system disruption also takes place.Keeping all the possibilities of the things that may go south for you, you cannot avoid the fact that system integration runs today\u2019s competitive landscape.Now, there\u2019s no reason to be dismayed! You can follow some tips, ensuring that your system integration efforts do not go off the deep end.What to DoWe will be elaborating the steps which will help you in successful system integration. Here are a few suggestions!Start mapping your data\nGain a clear picture of all the data you have in each system before you start bringing them together.\nEven after a thorough check, be prepared for a few shortcomings.\nMake sure you have scheduled some project time to deal with data mapping.There is a perfect chance that your initial list will end up being incomplete and critical data may not be identified in the first couple of rounds.Flush out incompatible data formatsYour system uses certain characters while the one you are integrating with does not. Such incompatibilities lead to severe issues.\nEach system follows its programmed parameters.\nThe data you stored in your system may not get saved in the same\nIncorporate error handling and validation to minimize such problems.Only use the data you needData that \u2019\u2019might be helpful\u2019\u2019 is not to be included.Focus only on what \u2019\u2019is helpful.\u2019\u2019Data that \u2019\u2019is helpful\u2019\u2019 may need a change in scope whereas data that \u2019\u2019might be helpful\u2019\u2019 may consist of enhancements that could probably come in handy as the project progresses.\nDo not fail while differentiating between these two as doing so will lead to an increased expenditure of time and money; even failure.\nMapping only the relevant and most valuable data is cost-effective and efficient.\nIndividual departments do not need to see data that isn\u2019t relative.For example, Coupler.io will export QuickBooks to google sheets for easy storage of important data. You can export your data at ease and do the trickiest manipulations with data in spreadsheets.Simplify your processes.Build a streamlined business process before you implement the system data integration program.\nThe flow of the data is essential, but so is the understandability of the business process as it helps the automation sync with the process.\nYou must go through each process with the respective users; you will know where the issues exist and how to tackle them.What Not to DoHaven\u2019t you heard? Caution is better than cure.Do not manage the project through email\nLook for specific tools that can meet the project\u2019s exact requirements. Also, get everybody involved to use these tools.\nEmails are too risky.\nSwitch to collaborative tools and centralize the project information.Combat miscommunicationIntegration projects are complex by nature because they involve the management of applications and processes tied to multiple systems.Establish a glossary of sorts to minimize errors in communication. Avoid using technical-jargon when it is not entirely necessary. Keep things simple.In conclusion, it is quite apparent that data integration is a very complicated task.

You can streamline it with GMB management software.\nDo all your pages have compelling and unique metadata?\nHow do your landing pages compare to the other search results?If your titles are bad and your value propositions don\u2019t stand out, users won\u2019t click on your website.Here\u2019s a checklist you can work through to cover the SEO basics.It\u2019s fairly long, but you don\u2019t need to do everything at once.Just do a couple of things whenever you have a little bit of time.Keep investing in refining your SEO strategy, jump on niche keywords and industry developments as they emerge.In SEO, being the first to capitalize the market is incredibly powerful.You can also use SEO report template to manage your activities in a better way.Clean up your sales copyCan you genuinely say that you\u2019re 100% happy with every single word in your sales funnel?Don\u2019t stop your brand copywriting project at the first iteration.Keep pushing to increase\non-page engagement\nconversion rates\nconverted leadsCopy is an important trust signal, and good copy will help drive sales years after it\u2019s first written.Start with an audit.Great copy can take a fair while to write, but it doesn\u2019t take long to scan what you currently have.Read through the text on your website, especially on the homepage and product/service pages.How does it strike you?Do you think \u2019\u2019Hey, I trust this company!And, these products/services sound great!\u2019\u2019?If not, why not?Is there something missing?Is there a problem with what\u2019s there?You might be surprised by how often companies and online stores lose sales through basic copy problems.Typos, grammatical mistakes, missing details, unclear phrasing.Problems that don\u2019t take very long to fix, even if you don\u2019t have a professional copywriter at hand.HostGator have a pretty convincing landing page that\u2019s direct and clear, with just a hint of personality.Directly appealing to the user with terms like \u201cYou\u2019re different. So are we\u201d is a simple way to build trust.And if you\u2019re not hammering home the most persuasive points in a really obvious way, you\u2019re playing a dangerous game.Turns out people don\u2019t like to read very thoroughly online.Get a killer sales landing page put together by copy ninjas and you will see a guaranteed sales uplift.Get users to review youWe derive a lot of our confidence in a value proposition from what other people think of it.As such, if you\u2019re not making a big deal of solid recommendation that comes your way, you\u2019re likely missing out on some sales.You might already have some glowing testimonials and customer reviews on your website.If so, that\u2019s an excellent start. But however many you have, you don\u2019t have enough.You need more.The more comments, the betterIf you\u2019re not already seeking feedback at every opportunity, you should reconsider your sales process.Make sure to reach out to existing customers, clients and partners for comment, and keep collecting that information indefinitely.It\u2019s enormously valuable.Also, don\u2019t overlook the presentation.What seems more persuasiveA small italicized comment at the bottom of a product page?OrA big bold highlighted quote right next to the product image?It\u2019s the latter, of course, and enormously so.You want everyone to know about the positive feedback.That calls for the website equivalent of shouting it from the rooftops.Think about how you can use genuine user comments and video reviews throughout your sales process.\nIn email marketing\nfeedback forms\nsocial ads, etc.The more community-focused your sales messaging is, the better.Host a sale or give deep discountsThis one is straight from the textbook, but you can\u2019t overlook the classics, and nothing can spark a speedy turnaround in fortunes like a sale.Opening up your sales strategy with an outlet or budget arm of the busi"

            "content": "An opaque sales culture is like a battlefield where distrust, conflict, and dispute prevails.\u00a0Instead of working together as a company, sales reps turn into rivals with a sole agenda to succeed; by hook or by crook.Example: A company appoints four sales teams and creates competition between them with the titles like \u2019\u2019best team for the quarter\u2019 and \u2019\u2019star performer of the team\u2019 attached with rewards and incentives. Instead of developing a healthy attitude towards the competition they create an aura of bitterness by stealing each other\u2019s sales deals and taking their credit to win the title.You worked hard on a deal. Later you learn that your colleague from another team approached the prospect and closed the deal. Dishertening isn\u2019t it.This happens when there is lack of transparency, as the processes and crucial customer information are not streamlined systematically.Such factors have a deep impact on the sales reps; they feel demoralized and overburdened due to which they are unable to deliver their best performance. Injecting transparency to create a positive aura of salesBuilding a positive environment of transparency is necessary.For a business it reduces loss taken by revenue growth of the company, in case your sales team loses a really important deal.To create a healthy competition there needs to be visibility of the sales cycle.Sales reps need to know what\u2019s happening in the organization.Which companies are being approached and who is handling which customer\u2019s account.Such clarity will remove the bitterness and help sales team to compete with the right spirit.Wondering how to create transparency?Simple solutionBreak the wall by bringing all the sales rep on a single platformIt is difficult to bring synergy between the teams in a closed work culture, so you need to break the wall and bring everyone on the same platform.All hands need to be on the deck to steer the business in the profitable direction.It can only happen by inculcating transparency in your work processes.For doing that, you need a technology that houses all the activities on a single platform and fosters a collaborative work culture.Technology like CRM can helpCRM based in the cloud enhances sales team transparency by providing a 360-degree view of each deal and its information in the sales pipeline.With a centralized database, they can have easy access to crucial information and get insights into the sales activities through well-represented graphs and reports.Sales reps can see what\u2019s done and what is in progress.It also allows them to track their performance and compare it with other sales reps to see how things are developing. CRM = Transparent work cultureClarity in salesSales reps can work more efficiently when data is well-maintained and synchronized.In a cloud environment, sales reps get a unified view of the data.The contact information and data related to the sales pipeline is systematically structured for quick reference. Centralized data speeds up work processes and facilitates more accurate analysis.With detailed timeline and sales records, you can plan strategies to move ahead of your competition.Shared workspaceCloud boosts team collaboration.Any information updated or any task accomplished by a sales rep is instantly shared with other sales teams.Through timely notifications, every sales rep is informed when a new deal is added, or the old one is closed by any sales rep of any team.With a cloud-based CRM, every interaction with a customer is transparent.All the record of the past communication is maintained so that if at any rep leaves the company, his colleague can take it forward from there without having to start from the scratch.Use apps to communicate betterA CRM allows you to integrate with applications like Slack to seamlessly communicate and exchange vital information in the group.Sales teams can easily brainstorm ideas together and even solve issues using such apps.It creates transparency within the team as everyone is abreast with the team mate\u2019s sales activities. With the integration, sales reps will automatically be notified in slack about their deal activities taking place in the CRM.This way, they can seamlessly communicate and create sales strategies for powering their performance.To concludeTransparency is a positive air of motivation for the sales team to deliver satisfactory performance.High sales targets and management\u2019s expectations have already pressurized the sales reps.The case gets worse if the competition with different sales teams in the organization gets ugly.Such scenario can be avoided by adding transparency and clarity in the work process.\n\nWith a CRM like Salesmate, sales team members can know who is handling which customer\u2019s account.All the records are stored in the CRM there are fewer chances of treachery and dispute.There won\u2019t be any blame game, as all details will be visible to all members of the team.In fact, when the sales reps see another team\u2019s progress through the sales timeline, th"

            "content": "A healthy sales pipeline is a must to achieve your revenue goals and objectives. However, the health of the sales pipeline depends on the number of quality prospects it holds. Sometimes sales teams emphasize on increasing the volume of the deals in the sales pipeline, but if they are not converting into sales, then there isn\u2019t any value of those deals. To increases sales, you need to have high-quality prospects in your sales pipelines as they maximize your margins, shorten the sales cycle length, increases productivity and saves time.What are quality prospects?High-quality prospects refer to potential buyers that fit into all the criteria you have set to meet the desired sales results which in turn has a significant impact on the overall growth of your business. Such prospects display genuine interest in your product and have fewer chances of quitting in mid-way of the sales cycle. Connecting with the right prospect reduces risks and increases the chances of meeting the sales targets as you will see less dropout and more conversions in your sales pipeline.You can\u2019t accidentally come across a quality prospect; efforts and perseverance are needed to fill your sales pipeline with high-quality prospects.Here are few tactics to fill your sales pipeline with quality prospects:Create an ideal customer personaHaving a roadmap is helpful in quickly reaching your destination, similarly describing your ideal customer persona will help you in approaching and connecting with quality prospects. With accurate target audience insights, you will have a specific direction to focus that will make your work simpler.To create a highly effective ideal customer persona, you need to consider the following points:\nCompanies from which industry will benefit the most from your product?\nOnce you identify the industry, you need to define the business size you want to approach\nTry to know their annual revenue to understand if they can pay you for the value you provide\nUnderstand the challenges faced by the specific industry you intend to target.Analyze your successful customersYour successful past can be a strong base for achieving success in future too. You need to identify the traits and characteristics of the customers who are succeeding with your solution. Create a list of successful customers to analyze their buying behavior and other information like which sector they belong to, what is their company size and annual revenue.  You can even contact them to understand how much value are they getting from your product. It will give you a tentative idea of what kind of businesses you need to approach to achieve cent percent positive results.Analysis of lost prospectsLost prospects are as important as successful customers. It is disappointing when a prospect does not turn into a customer even after spending so much time and efforts. Knowing what went wrong in the past, can help in being cautious in the future.  Analyzing the lost prospects will acquaint you with the weak areas and mistakes that you need to avoid for increasing your conversion ratio. Understanding the factors for prospect\u2019s dissatisfaction can help you in improving performance and offering better solutions.Below are the points that you need to pay attention to while analyzing a lost prospect-\nThe causes of prospect loss\nWhat characteristics do these companies who quit in the past have in common?\nWhat were the issues faced by these companies that they refused to move ahead?\nWhat were the factors missing in your solution according to these companies?\nHow much time did you spend on the lost prospects?Separate lead generation from sales processLead generation and sales process are two main but different aspects of sales that shouldn\u2019t be combined. In most of the organization, a sales rep is the one who handles the complete sales process from approaching a prospect to creating a deal and successfully closing it.  In this case, the sales personnel don\u2019t have enough time to concentrate on one aspect like if he is focusing on nurturing a deal, he won\u2019t get time to conduct research and identify a quality prospect. There should be a special marketing team to connect with high-quality prospects.In most of the cases even if the organization has its in-house marketing team, there are chances that they don\u2019t coordinate with the sales teams. Without the help of the sales team, targeting the right audience can be a difficult task for the marketing team. For achieving the company\u2019s revenue goal, the sales and marketing team need to walk together in unity. The two teams need to coordinate and discuss the requirement for achieving better sales results.Use a CRM to maintain qualityOnce you identify the potential prospect, taking them forward in the sales pipeline is your responsibility. Even if you have approached the right prospect, but if you do not take care of them with on-time follow-ups and responses then there are chances they might lose interest in your product.

            "title": "How sales can benefit from project management concepts",
            "content": "How can you apply project management concepts to improve your company\u2019s sales process? To start with, you can consider the different stages of the sales process which are prospecting, qualifying, proposal, deal closure, and implementation as project milestones. In short, disciplined selling requires smart project management skills \u2019 you need to identify a goal, make good use of resources and activities, and align the work of all parties involved in carrying out the project plan.Your company\u2019s sales process can be compared to a project plan. Sales reps act as project managers \u2019 they develop the plan, align resources like company, partner, and customer, and lead from the front to execute the plan.They must also learn to use software to ensure good project oversight and management. Just as project managers will go Microsoft Project courses (this one for example), sales managers will need to learn to use sales management software. Thus, many project management concepts, approaches, disciplines, and skills apply to sales as well.The sales process can be treated as a type of project management. Sales professionals can enhance their skills by learning about project management concepts. They can read good books and articles on project management to improve their knowledge.In addition, sales professionals can get support from their organization by portraying their sale campaign efforts in terms of project management. Plus, they can manage the sales process and sales strategies in the same disciplined manner as successful projects are handled.Similar to project management, successful sales processes involve smart planning and implementation. Project management uses a systematic method to take brainstorming and creative thinking to effective implementation. Sales professionals can combine proven sales theories with project management\u2019s control, monitoring, and execution to make their company more competitive. Read on to learn about areas in sales management that are influenced by project management concepts.6 Ways Project Management Relates to Sales/Marketing\n Branding StrategiesSuccessfully executing a brand strategy needs attention to facts and substantial investment. Your company\u2019s future depends on proper execution of brand strategies. This process involves close coordination and collaboration between your company\u2019s different functional units which is similar to project management. Brand management needs consistent implementation and attention to details as well as the larger picture \u2019 this is also the basis of project management.\n Customer Relationship ManagementIt is easier and more cost-effective to get repeat business from existing clients than to acquire new ones. The project manager can help in this task as they need to build a good relationship and rapport with clients. Therefore, apart from the skills needed for successful technical and commercial execution of projects, project managers should also possess the skills required to enhance the company\u2019s sales capabilities.\n Promises to CustomersSometimes, in the bid to close the deal, sales professionals promise deliverables that can be hard for project team members to achieve. Sales activities thus heavily impact project initiation and planning. Sales professionals need to understand their role clearly and how it impacts project management workflows. This will enable them to define client needs with clarity and help set realistic project schedules and pricing.\n Product or Service LaunchYou can effectively apply project management concepts to your company\u2019s launch of a new product or service. Follow project management principles to adopt an organized approach, get confidence and buy-in from company employees, and implement a streamlined and efficient process that reduces time-to-market.\n Sales Force AutomationSales Force Automation (SFA) can also benefit from project management principles. Companies and clients can collaborate to create a robust project initiation process. This process can start early in your company\u2019s sales cycle and when the deal is closed you have clear objectives, goals, charter, and authority in place. Process focus is also improved by aligning SFA with project management principles. SFA projects focus on implementation of products and product deliverables and not the on immense change brought about by SFA. Project management changes the focus to the activities and tasks that are needed for change.\n Sales InitiativesSales managers can no longer depend only on their personality to lead their team or close deals. In today\u2019s cutthroat marketplace, products are getting commoditized and margins reduced. Plus, it has become hard to differentiate your company from the rest of the competition. Therefore, sales reps need to act and think like project managers. They should focus on improving the conventional sales workflow by focusing on customer needs and how to address them in the sales cycle and later while implementing the solution accepted by"

However, as you move ahead and encounter different business challenges, the difficulty level escalates with the limitations of an excel.Limitations of using Excel \u2013\nYou cannot share data between different locations\nThere is lack of transparency between the sales teams\nYou cannot track your emails or know if a client has opened your email\nThere are high chances of losing data\nIf the list exceeds hundred, it becomes challenging to manage the data\nThe situation becomes worst when you think of expanding your team\nYou cannot check the status of a deal\nIf you add a data it won\u2019t show up in other files means rest of the team member will not receive the updated information\nYou will need a separate messaging and calling software, calendar and various other tools to function effectivelyThese limitations, can not only be a hindrance in your workflow but also affect your business growth and make your survival difficult in the industry. The best solution to deal with these issues is to switch to a CRM (customer relationship management technology) that will not only help in building a healthy relationship with your customers but also organize your various operations. It is the best tool to gain control over your data and streamline your workflow to accelerate productivity and augment profitability.CRM is a perfect partner of your sales team, as it gives them clear visibility of their sales cycle and provides them frequent updates about their deals. It keeps every member of the team on the same page and helps the head of the team to assign tasks and analyze the performance of each member to increase the win rate.With the rising competition in the industry, CRM has become a powerful strategy of businesses, as it enriches organization\u2019s work processes and helps them in staying ahead. To beat the rising competition, it is necessary to upgrade from conventional excel files to the modern way of operating business.Still confused? Don\u2019t worry read below to clear your doubt about choosing a CRM over an excel file \u2013Workflow AutomationEliminate the repetitive task of entering data in a spreadsheet with a CRM, that automates processes and saves your precious time. Using workflow automation, CRM allows you to automatically fetch contact data from web forms or survey sheets and store it as deals or contacts in your CRM as per the workflow set by you. It gives sales rep time to focus on more important aspects like approaching new prospects and following up on old ones. Once new deals enter your sales pipeline, the CRM helps nurture these deals by automating your emails using workflows.E.g. An automatically generated email is sent out for introducing your product or service or following up with prospects regarding deals.TrackingCRM unlike excel does more than just storing data. It allows you to keep a stringent track on your deal activities and emails to ensure you do not skip an opportunity. CRM keeps you updated with the past and present actions of each deal and notifies you when an email is clicked and read. Such crucial information can be a strong base to take immediate actions and aid you in clinching more deals. It is also a useful tool for the sales leaders to track their team\u2019s performance to know if they are meeting their target and helps in identifying the areas that need improvement.ReportingReports are vital to track and analyze the progress of your business towards its vision and goals.

CRM helps you in doing that; using the past data, you can forecast the sales for the upcoming months. With a good CRM, you can make accurate sales projections which will help in identifying problems and planning the course of action to achieve successful results.Sales MetricsMetrics are essential to grow your business and they are mainly very critical in sal"

With the mounting sales pressure, a CRM software seems like an albatross around the neck for your sales team. Learning a new tool is challenging, and in this case, it also demands extra efforts.Filling in details about clients consumes time which your sales rep could have spent on convincing a potential prospect. It is an add-on to their routine task which also distracts them as their core focus is sales target which they want to achieve by hook or by crook. You have your money invested in this software, and your sales professionals have their eyes set on the money attached in the form of incentives to close a deal.If you put yourself in the shoes of your sales rep, these extra efforts will seem frustrating, especially when you are already concentrating on proliferating the revenue ratio of your company. But, as an entrepreneur, you need to change their views about a CRM by showing them the brighter side of using this technology. Make their work as easier as possible to help them have an optimistic view of this technology. CRM is a beneficial tool, but its usefulness depends on the way it is used.Below are few tips to present a better picture of the CRM software to motivate your sales reps to use it:Individual trainingSales reps are proficient at selling, it is their core, and they know how to do it well. However, that does not mean they are sound with technology too; some sales reps are not good at quick learning and adapting new technology. So, assign a tech personnel to help the individual sales rep in understanding the system. Only when they are clear with all the function of the software, they can operate it and gradually get accustomed to it.Integrate your CRMMake their job easier by integrating your CRM with the applications your sales reps are already using. It will help them in understanding the true potential of the CRM. The more benefits they will come across, the more interested they will be in using the software. By integrating two applications, they can automate the information filling process, and without putting in efforts, they can import all the essential data they need to maintain records. Integration will reduce their load; they can automatically extract data, send bulk emails and follow ups with potential prospects. This will save their time and help them concentrate on achieving their sales target.Explain its valueAcquaint them with the advantages of a CRM software. We don\u2019t tend to understand the importance of anything till we don\u2019t know its true value. CRM software gives sales rep the flexibility to function at ease by centralizing all the data they need to foster customer relationship. They can instantly access the information they need to interact with their clients from any device at any hour of the day. It will help them in structuring their sales process; they can seamlessly monitor each movement of the prospect as it moves from one stage to another. Sales pipeline CRM is a handy tool to create reports and track the records of the clients automatically. Using this high-end technology, sales rep can measure the engagement of the leads and keep an eye on their various activities like calls, emails, and files. It is the best solution to enhance performance and drive sales.Provide incentives and publicize achievementsIt is exasperating when we are forced to do something we dislike. Pressurizing your sales team to use a CRM won\u2019t help, instead try encouraging them through rewards and recognition. Give extra incentives to those who achieve their sales target by sincerely using a CRM. Publicly announce their achievement through emails and meetings so that other too are inspired to willingly use it.The bottom lineThis technology is easy, effective and convenient; your sales rep just needs to understand its real value. CRM isn\u2019t a time waster, in fact, it eases their job and gives them extra time to do more tasks. If utilized in the apt way, CRM can be very beneficial for the sales rep and the company. But, the benefits depend on the CRM you choose. You need to identify the right solution that caters to your business and sales rep need.

Take trials of the software and have one or two members of your sales team use and evaluate various software. You cannot risk the situation where after implementing a hefty CRM, the need of switching to another CRM arises.Mobility or Mobile CRMThe current sales team is more active outside the cubicle and office space, and they want a CRM that suits their mobility.

            "title": "Prospecting tips to increase your sales pipeline",
            "content": "In this ever-changing business scenario, the method of prospecting is also changing and to match up with the process of successful prospecting; you also need to change your daily sales processes.Sales processes are developed over time and vary from organization to organization. These processes help you in managing your valuable time and resources and create a pool of opportunities that assist you in maintaining a steady business or grow your business from scratch.The sales scene has changed a lot in the past few years and if we take these study into account then, on an average fifty-two sales calls are made daily by the salespeople, if we bifurcate these stats further, then it takes roughly eight calls to reach to your prospects.Another interesting study states that 84% of the B2B decision makers rely on referrals, but only 11% sale personals ask for any references although if they know that the customers are happy, they should at least try instead of shying away from the golden opportunity.To help you overcome the various changes that the concept of prospecting has gone through, here are five great prospecting tips that we recommend for you:Tip 1 \u2019 Strategize Your Cold Calls!Salesperson: \u2019\u2019It is so difficult to get a favorable response over the phone nowadays, what should I do to have a successful conversation?\u2019\u2019We understand the frustration when you cannot get your leads to their phone, and we know it is indeed challenging, so when you do, be well prepared.Here is one easy strategy:Combine an introductory email with your phone callToday your target audience, the prospects, are part of the generation which is always on-the-go and combining your emails with calls will be a much frictionless way of reaching out to them.Always send an email before you give your prospects a call and keep your email content short and to the point. When you are having a conversation, just remind them of an email that has been sent to them, explain what that email is about and what are the benefits of your product and services and let them know how you can help them out, hence fulfilling the purpose of your call.No one likes to answer a call that is not giving them any benefit against the amount of time he or she is spending on it.Tip 2 \u2019 Anticipate Prospect ReactionIn the process of prospecting, it is inevitable to avoid situations of objections or avoiding the obstacles.The better outcome from this situation is that there is a degree of similarity in the objections and obstacle that your sales and marketing teams might face. So it becomes imperative to understand these situations and prepare your team to handle the prospects reactions.Create a list that has all the similar and common objections and questions that your team has faced from prospects and then accordingly create your responses against each of them.Now that you have your list of prospects reactions and the solutions, practice them in your training sessions and make them sound real and convincing so that if your salespeople have to reply to a prospects question, it should not sound as if it is being said aloud via a script.Convincing the prospects that you can give them solution against their doubts will build confidence in them, eventually helping you up your closing rate.Tip 3 \u2013 Approach Your Prospects And Leads CarefullyPromotional emails are the trend in today\u2019s market. These emails are personalized as per the customer\u2019s personality, online search history, spending style and so on. Drafting and shooting customized emails to your prospects makes them feel special and more valued.So when you email or call your prospects shortly, make sure you follow these two points:Setting an Appointment:While sending an email for requesting an appointment with your prospects, make sure that you draft the email by personalizing it and provide a proper call-to-action. For example:Customize the email like this: \u2019\u2019Our organization works with companies that have a business process similar to yours, they were facing troubles with their inventory management and this how our service helped them in saving XYZ amount.\u2019\u2019Explain how your organization\u2019s services were of help to these companies and cite favorable outcomes. Wrap up your email with a subtle call-to-action: \u201cI would like to request a meeting with you to discuss some ideas that might help out you in managing your organizations XYZ issues, I am available this Wednesday at 4:00 pm. Will this be a good time to book an appointment slot with you?\u201dIf one strategy works for one particular prospect, it does not mean it will work for the others. You need to have adequate strategies in place to deal with dynamic prospects in your prospect pool.Nurturing Your Leads:We do not need to explain how the emails for seeking appointments and nurturing your leads are different; the name says it all.Lead nurturing emails intend to provide some insights on your services and products to the leads while making them subtly go through your sales process.Yo"
