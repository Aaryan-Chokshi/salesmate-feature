And today, we are discussing one of the most effective sales frameworks- ANUM.,Moreover, you can set your qualification process on autopilot.,So, let’s find all the nitty-gritty of the ANUM framework.,What is the ANUM sales qualification framework?,Ken Krogue develops the ANUM framework. It is a lead qualification framework that takes a customer-centric approach and helps sales reps identify sales opportunities.,It is a restructured version of the BANT framework where authority is prioritized over budget.,Prospecting isn’t easy. Reps invest a lot of effort and time in contacting the right audience.,In such a scenario, realizing that you reached out to an irrelevant prospect is devastating.,ANUM is a practical framework as it qualifies based on whether they have decision-making powers or not.,Also, beginning your sales pitch focusing on a budget can be daunting. Here’s why the ANUM framework seems effective, as it considers money criteria later.,Moreover, this framework helps reps save time and effort by deciding whether they are dealing with the right prospects or need to look for the correct ones.,Let’s understand each qualification criterion of ANUM.,The complete process of the ANUM qualification framework,1. Authority,You just can’t afford to work on a lead that has no power to make the purchasing decision.,This is why the ANUM framework prioritizes authority. It lets you discover whether you are pitching your winning script to the decision-maker or not.,But who is\/are the potential decision-makers?,Well- it depends.,There is no perfect definition of the decision-maker. It is purely subjective to the company and its organizational structure.,At some companies, it may be a CFO or a departmental head; in some processes, there may be a group of people who need to be involved throughout the process, and so on.,The technique is to ask the right qualifying question to the MQLs to discover whether they have the decision-making authority or not.,To understand the authority of a prospect to make the purchase decision, you should ask the questions mentioned below:,Can you help me know your company’s buying process, especially with purchasing a product or service like ours?,Is there anyone else from your team that needs to be included in this conversation?,How are purchasing decisions typically made in your organization for products\/services like ours?,Who is responsible for making the final purchase decision?,Can you include the (decision maker) in our call?,Can you help me with the coordinates of (the decision maker) to contact them directly?,What if you discover that the lead you’re communicating with for sales isn’t the decision-maker?,Well, you shouldn’t cut off the lead who isn’t the decision-maker, as they can serve as a bridge to reach the person concerned.,2. Need,Once you’ve tapped the decision-maker, you must understand their requirements and expectations from a brand like yours.,Understanding their pain points and taking the conversation in the right direction is vital.,At this stage, you should be aware of their role and responsibilities. This helps you to offer a tailored solution to them.,Identifying customers’ needs would help you offer a consultive sales approach that boosts the probability of deal conversion.,Nearly 53% of sales representatives believe the consultative selling approach makes their sales process more efficient.,As this method considers having a consultation session with the potential buyer that caters to their requirement.,Below are the questions you can ask the lead to understand their needs:,What’s the key problem your company\/ team\/ department faces?,What’s the source of this key problem?,What’s the goal your team\/company aims at achieving?,Why hasn’t it been addressed before?,What would be the ideal solution for this problem?,3. Urgency,At this stage, you must determine the importance and extremity of your prospect’s purchase plan.,This phase is even denoted as priority and timing in some other frameworks like (BANT, FAINT, CHAMP, etc.),This stage evaluates how urgently your prospect requires the solution to their problem.,However, there is an urgency in an ideal situation at this stage since you already know the prospects are facing problems and need a solution.,So, here’s how you can even directly discover these factors by asking a question like:,What’s the timeframe for getting the problem fixed?,How long can you wait to get the problem solved?,Where does this solution stand on your priority list?,How important is it to get this solution in place?,Also, you can even discover the urgency of the purchase by getting to know the company’s general news, like its structural changes, mergers, acquisition, etc.,4. Money,The above qualification will help you understand who you are selling to and how to pitch your product as the solution to their problem.,But you must qualify your prospect for the most important stage- budget.,Though self-explanatory, the budget takes a backseat when you communicate with the right person and offer them the required solution.,The businesses have a budget range per the market prices, so if you can convince your prospects that your solution is a game-changer, they will probably be flexible about it.,Through the below qualifying questions, you provide certainty about their budget:,Do you have a budget for this solution?,How much are you willing to spend on an accurate solution?,Would you mind spending higher than you’re planned budget on this solution?,Is there anything else you’re currently allocating the budget on?,Let’s find out how you can implement ANUM to qualify leads for sales.,An example of the ANUM qualification framework,This example will help you understand how to leverage ANUM for qualification.,Ron(sales rep): Hi, I am Ron from XYZ software company. Am I talking to Mr. Dave, the head of marketing at ABC company?,Dave(prospect): Yes, what is this call regarding?,Ron: We noticed you recently filled out a web form on our site expressing interest in our marketing automation software.

Before discussing your solution, who else in your company is involved in the decision-making process?,Dave: Oh, It’s me and the CMO.,Ron: Okay, thank you. Please, can you help me understand the critical problem you and your team face?,Dave: Until now, our team has been manually doing most of the outreach activities and nurturing campaigns. But now, we’re planning to implement automation in most lead generation and management tasks.,Ron: Well, sir, you can automate all the repeated and time-consuming tasks like lead generation and management, outreach, nurturing and follow up, and much more with our powerful automation suit.,Dave: Wow, this sounds helpful.,Ron: Thanks, sir. May I know where this solution stands on your priority list?,Dave: Well, we plan to start with automation by the end of this month.,Ron: Okay, thanks for letting me know.

{"prompt":"🚀 Salesmate Experience Updates: 11 exciting things happened this March ->","completion":" A couple of important additions and improvements this month.  There’s no specific theme to this month’s updates, but we have meaningful changes to Automation Journeys, Chat Journeys, Add-ons, etc.And also, Lead Parsing is here! Long story short, we picked issues based on customer interactions and went with them. Hope you find these updates useful 😊  1. Plan communication sensibly with Sequence Filters Communication wins customers – that’s a fact and we know it. But sometimes, we completely lose track and end up communicating with subscribers\/prospects a bit too much!   That’s why Sequence filters are here, so you can find out exactly how many contacts are enrolled in Sequences right now. Or you can find out which Sequence ended last, so you can plan a new campaign for these specific contacts.  In simple words, these filters will help you identify contacts associated with different Sequences with their respective stages, so you can plan your communication in a sensible way. Learn more about Sequence Filters 2. Deeper email insights for contacts using new filters If you are always curious about knowing who opened or replied to an email with a subject, campaign, or template, then our new search feature is for you. No more jumping between multiple contacts to see if they have opened your email or not; simply filter them out and plan your next set of actions.3. Full-proof Sequence communications We have added a new option to send a test email and text before making the Sequence live. Quickly choose a deal or contact to see how personalization fields will appear within your email and how specific contact is going to view it within their inbox. This new option is available under any of the sequence steps, simply click on the Actions buttons and select the “Send Test Email” option from the list. 4. Take personalized outbound messaging to the next level with Contact & Company fields in Chat Journeys It’s much easier to leverage Chat Journeys for highly personalized outbound messaging.  While choosing Audience, you can find all the Contact and Company fields. So now, you can choose a specific audience to show personalized messages, offers, promotions, etc. So, targeting a message to a handful of customers is also possible with Chat Journeys. 5. Associate Tags to Chat Journey conversations for stronger insights Tags are one of the most crucial elements in conversation analysis, especially after the new Tag Reports. And this update will power up the analysis further.   You can associate multiple tags to conversations handled by Chat Journeys. It’s super helpful when you have multiple automation in motion. For example, you’d be able to see the number of conversations the bot handled for Pricing, Customer Support, Feature Requests, etc.  Learn about Tags to Chat Journey 6. Improve outbound messaging with a new Chat Journey trigger Our chat journeys now support a new trigger called “Event”, which broadens the scope of possibilities. Now send a message or show help to the visitor when they interact with your website or App. E.g., Triggering a chat journey is possible when they add or remove a product from the cart, book a meeting, or even submit a form for a case study download.  7. Bring out lead data from your lead source emails automatically Every business relies on multiple sources for quality leads.  The real problem is when some providers share lead information via email. Though these emails are very simple in nature, they come with a big problem! You have to manually create new leads by copy-pasting their names, companies, and locations, into CRM.  A lead parser can simplify this task and save hours of manual data entry for you. We are launching email parsers to automatically bring out lead data from such emails and turn them into Contacts in Salesmate. With Salesmate’s email parsers…,You can directly assign these leads to a user or a team (round-robin) You can associate Tags that can be amazing filters for sorting You can directly add them to a List for shooting highly personalized campaigns So, no more data entry for these emails, all you have to do is choose from the list of pre-defined providers or set up a custom provider. Don’t worry, the process is quite simple for both.  You can learn more about them in our support article or connect with our customer success team for a quick solution. Right now, we have started with two lead providers – Homepie and IndiaMART. If you want us to add more lead sources, please connect with our support team. We’d be happy to move forward with your request 🙂8. Contact creation for text received from unknown numbers A simple text response can deliver an amazing experience for your brand. And you know, you can very well automate using Salesmate. But that was particularly difficult when a text is coming from an unknown number.  Well, not anymore. Now, in Automation Journeys, you can create new contacts when text messages are received from unknown numbers. Salesmate will use the phone number as the name and create a new contact. Once a contact is created in Salesmate, you can execute further steps of automation and push them through the journey! Learn more about it 9.

{"prompt":"What is incremental sales? Definition and formula ->","completion":" Key TakeawaysIncremental sales is a metric that helps determine the difference between actual sales you generate during a specific timeframe and the estimated sales you would have generated.Incremental sales is an extremely important metric or KPI for sales managers, sales teams, and the business itself.Incremental sales formula: Incremental sales = Total Sales – Baseline SalesMarketing is all about being memorable to potential customers.By consistently engaging with them and making a good impression, you increase the chances that they will immediately think of your brand when they need a product or service you offer. And the primary objective of putting in marketing efforts is to increase demand and boost revenue.But the only way you can ensure that your efforts are paying off is by measuring the right metric of the campaign. Which is that metric? – Incremental Sales! Indeed many other factors are essential, such as conversion rate, cost per lead, engagement, and more.But incremental sales is a metric that will help evaluate whether your marketing effort is showing results or not.But before we see how you can measure incremental sales, let’s take a quick look at what exactly is incremental sales.What is incremental sales? Incremental sales is a metric that helps determine the difference between actual sales you generate during a specific timeframe and the estimated sales you would have generated.And, because the growth in sales is usually a result of promotional campaigns, it’s also referred to as a sales metric or a KPI (key performance indicator) that helps evaluate marketing effectiveness and performance of campaigns.The two most important things here are baseline sales, which refers to the revenue you generate without marketing efforts. And the second thing is campaigns, which in this context, are the marketing channels you choose to reach your potential customers. So, this includes campaigns such as PPC advertisements, influencer marketing, social media advertisement, influencer marketing, and other such campaigns. Why do you need to measure incremental sales? Measuring incremental sales truly has its perks.It is a KPI that can shape the way your sales numbers grow. And, if the revenue you’ve evaluated after measuring incremental sales is high, the campaign’s performance is good.Whereas, if the numbers are negative, there are areas where improvement could be made.Incremental sales can help identify loopholes in the sales process, enables better allocation of marketing funds, and helps identify shortcomings. As a result, increased profit is achieved.Moreover, keeping track of incremental sales can help better strategize your upcoming promotional campaigns.  How to calculate incremental sales?  The incremental sales formula highlights the growth in sales due to promotional activities during a set timeframe.Let’s learn how to calculate incremental sales to evaluate the success of marketing campaigns.Incremental sales formula: Incremental Sales = Total Sales – Baseline Sales Now, let’s clear out the concepts mentioned in the formula.  Total sales: It is the revenue your business generated during a set timeframe when the marketing campaigns were active.  Baseline sales: Itis the revenue you had projected your business would have generated during a set timeframe without marketing campaigns. Calculating baseline sales can be a little tricky! However, educated guesswork can help make this easier.A common approach is calculating the company’s average annual sales growth (without the marketing promotion).  Now, let’s plug in some real numbers in the formula and take a look at an incremental sales example for a better understanding: Let’s assume total sales for,2021: $170,000 2022: $200,000 As mentioned earlier, let’s roughly take an average of the last three years of average annual sales growth (promotion-free) for baseline sales.2018-2019 = $20,000 2019-2020 = $25,000 2020-2021 = $30,000 Average annual sales growth = $20000 + $25000 + $30000 = $75,000 Average annual sales growth = $75000 ÷ 3 = $25,000 Now as we know the average annual sales growth, can plug that into  Baseline sales for 2022 = $170000 (2021) + $25000 (average annual sales growth) = $145,000 So, the final figure would be: Incremental Sales = $200000 – $145000 = $55,000 Now that we’ve seen how to calculate incremental sales let’s look at the best practices.Best practices for improving incremental sales Here are a few important things you should keep in mind to improve incremental sales: 1. Utilize an efficient CRM for analytics: You’re well aware that keeping track of incremental sales and other important metrics of marketing campaigns isn’t a piece of cake. Instead, it requires a precise evaluation of the metrics.Also, if you don’t already use software to manage sales revenue and other crucial indicators, you might want to start by thinking about a potent CRM like Salesmate.  With interactive sales dashboards and simple analytics, Salesmate makes it extremely easy for businesses to make informed decisions from insightful sales reports.,Drive incremental sales growth with ease 🚀Discover how Salesmate reports and analytics can help you maximize your marketing efforts.Explore Now!2. Upselling and Cross-selling: Offering additional products or services to customers who are already purchasing can significantly improve sales figures.For instance, if someone is purchasing a laptop, there is a high chance that they might need a laptop bag or sleeve as well. So, finding products or services that complement each other can be a great way to ensure that your sales figures keep growing. 3. Choosing relevant KPIs Choosing the relevant KPIs is the second-best practice to improve your incremental sales.Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are various metrics that help you measure the efficiency of your marketing effort. Hence, adopting the correct ones along with incremental sales KPI is essential. Some common KPIs include:,New sales leads Conversion rate Click-through rate Lead-to-customer ratio, and more.4. Improve customer engagementYou should focus on improving customer engagement by personalizing your outreach, conveying informative and interactive content, reaching your target audience on their preferred channels, etc. The success of your marketing campaign depends on what scale your customer engagement is at. When you have good customer engagement, you will likely execute successful marketing campaigns.Also, targeting loyal customers would more likely be a success as they will quickly take action on the same. 5. Picking the right marketing channel Another practice to improve incremental sales is to use the right marketing channel.Since various target customers are available on various social media platforms, you must pick the right one to get good results.You can use various marketing channels like:,Social media marketing Email marketing Search Engine Optimization (SEO) marketing 6. Flexibility in adapting to the latest trends Marketing trends are dynamic, and so should your efforts. When hopping on a new marketing trend, you should be aware of these trends and then have flexible efforts to adopt one.Also, never resist trying new marketing strategies. Have a trial and error method to identify the best marketing campaign.Once you create, test, and analyze a successful marketing strategy, you can also witness substantial growth in your sales. Eventually leading to improved incremental sales.Conclusion Overall, incremental sales is a crucial metric for any business’s growth.Keeping track of the metric will help your business increase revenue as you can constantly optimize your marketing efforts and gain a competitive edge in the market. And strategies like upselling, cross-selling, product bundling, and many more, help ensure that the incremental sales figures keep growing.By implementing the best practices and measuring their effectiveness, businesses can stay ahead of the competition and continue to grow and thrive.\n"}

We achieved amazing results last year, improving everyday productivity, CX, and new feature development. We have solid plans for 2023, and this update is the first step. This January, we improved two of our existing features – Sequences and Automation Journeys and introduced a new one. What’s new in Salesmate Sequences? We’ve made a logic change for editing Sequence steps. If you change the step of the Sequence… – The logic remains the same for the Contacts that were personalized at the time of enrollment.  – But Contacts that were not personalized at the time of enrollment or were enrolled via Workflow or Automation Journey will follow the latest content from the sequence step at the time of execution.  So, from now onwards, you can change the step content, and it will be auto-updated for the contacts who haven’t reached that step.  So, no more editing within hundreds of contacts when you want to change the content or you want to rectify a mistake. Please note that this will only work for the contacts getting enrolled after 25th January 2023. Any contacts enrolled before that will still follow the old logic. Use your logo or image within Meeting Scheduler We have come up with a new option for the Meeting Scheduler where you can choose to show the logo on the landing or detail screen of any scheduler.  You can upload these logos using the Brand Book feature, which is limited to the Meeting Scheduler right now, but we plan to use it over multiple places in the coming days. Learn about Brand Book Smart Segment with Company Fields In Automation Journeys, Smart Segment is an important trigger to drive personalized campaigns.  Now, you can see “Company” fields in Smart Segment as well.

The calls were made by a total of 245 sales reps and the successful conversations were 1427. All the sales reps belong to the USA, and so do the prospects they connected with during this study. Let’s check out the findings.Best day to make a sales callAccording to the results, Wednesday is the best day to make a sales call with 136 successful call conversations on the very first attempt. Right after Wednesday, Thursday is the second-best day to make a call to prospects with 113 successful conversations. Friday would be the worst day to make a sales call with only 63 conversations. The difference in the number of conversations between the best day (Wednesday) and the worst day (Friday) is 53.67%.Make sales calls right from your CRMGet virtual numbers and start connecting with prospects!Try Salesmate for FreeBest time to make a sales callStarting from 9 am to 6 pm, in the evening between 4 pm to 5 pm would be the best time to make a sales call. The results also showed the worst time to make a sales call i.e. 5 pm to 6 pm in the evening. The second best time to make a sales call would be in the morning between 10 am to 11 am.The difference between the best time and the worst time to make a sales call is 88.88%.Response TimeIn this study, we also observed the response behavior of the prospects and we got some amazing results. The moment a lead is generated (or an inquiry is submitted), the first hour has the highest chances of conversation over a call. With 137 successful conversations in the first attempts, the study shows that the first hour from the lead generation is the most important hour to make a sales call. The number of responses drops drastically by 11 times from the first hour to the 8th hour of lead generation.In simpler words, the chances of having a successful conversation with prospects drop each hour after the lead is generated. ConsistencyIn this study, we have also made emphasis on the consistency of making sales calls to prospects. The number of attempts (or how many times to call a lead) made a lot of difference in the total number of conversations that took place (i.e. 1427).245 sales reps had a total of 489 successful conversations in the first attempt. In the second attempt, another 281 conversations took place. Interestingly, 328 more conversations were made in the third attempt by the sales reps. According to the results, sales reps managed to have conversations until the 6th attempt. In simpler words, for a prospect, it is advisable to make 6 attempts to have a successful sales conversation.Average call attempts by sales repsOut of 245 sales reps under the observation, only 29 have made a total of 6 attempts to a prospect. While we’ve already understood that a minimum of 6 attempts is advisable to reach a prospect, most sales reps give up on the third attempt. How Salesmate can help?Salesmate is a sales CRM designed for small and medium-scale businesses.
