      "Content: Key TakeawaysModern consulting businesses should have a strong marketing engine to build a solid sales pipeline.Strong sales pipeline results in increased conversions, better customer relationships, and organized processes for pipeline management.The primary steps to building an ideal sales pipeline involve generating leads effectively, prioritizing them, and qualification by the sales reps.\n",
      "According to a statistic, only 27% of the leads get closed. That means you need constant new prospects to close more deals. \n",
      "To accomplish that, your marketing team needs to set up its lead generation engine, and your sales team must constantly qualify leads to build a solid foundation. \n",
      "In order to do that, the marketing team must constantly come up with new leads, qualify them, and send them across the sales team to make the pipeline rich. \n",
      "I’m writing this article from a slightly different perspective. I believe modern consulting businesses should have a strong marketing engine to build a solid sales pipeline.  \n",
      "So, let’s dive right in. \n",
      "How to build a strong sales pipeline for your consulting business? \n",
      "Building your ideal sales pipeline consists of 4 key steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "Keep the marketing lead generation engine running \n",
      "Qualify leads for MQL \n",
      "Qualification by the sales team \n",
      "Create a meaningful sales pipeline \n",
      "\n",
      "Step 1: Keep the marketing lead generation engine running \n",
      "Every successful sales conversion begins with collecting the leads, qualifying them for marketing, and submitting them to the salespeople.  \n",
      "To get things in motion, marketers must take care of the basics: \n",
      "\n",
      "Identify your target audience \n",
      "Define the kind of content they would appreciate \n",
      "Plan a content execution strategy \n",
      "Distribute content meaningfully \n",
      "Collect leads through forms and newsletter signups \n",
      "\n",
      "1. Identify your target audience \n",
      "Building Ideal Customer Personas (ICPs) is the first step toward your digital marketing strategy and content creation.  \n",
      "Start by identifying your target client.  \n",
      "Research the critical decision-makers and power players capable of making the purchase decision. \n",
      "Segment and build a detailed audience list based on demographics, purchase intent, behaviors, and the goals they’d want to accomplish in the future by partnering with you and utilizing your services. \n",
      "Here’s an example of ICP for a consultancy that provides marketing services to SaaS platforms. \n",
      "\n",
      "Need more help with creating a customer persona? Download our free template. \n",
      "2. Define the kind of content they would appreciate \n",
      "Every marketing department has to create content to generate leads. \n",
      "Generally, for consulting, informative blogs, research reports, and whitepapers are more appropriate for your audience.  \n",
      "You can write more content that includes problem diagnosis, strategy implementation, market research reports, or financial planning.\n",
      "These are sure to help your audience and resonate with them. \n",
      "For instance, Animalz – a content marketing consulting company, writes thought leadership topics like these and gained attention from their target audience.\n",
      "\n",
      "People find podcasts more entertaining, as they can enjoy them on the go, on their own time. \n",
      "Look at McKinsey – A global management consultancy, and the topics they cover in their podcast: \n",
      "\n",
      "3. Prepare a content execution plan \n",
      "Before creating content, you need a solid content plan, and Cluster Approach is the best option right now.  \n",
      "In simple words, a cluster is a process of writing multiple child topics to gain authority over a parent topic.  \n",
      "For example: \n",
      "Parent Topic: Consulting services for SaaS   \n",
      "Child Topic: How much does a consulting charge to a SaaS business? \n",
      "It depends on the level of depth of a subject.\n",
      "Here’s an example of a parent topic, “Business Strategy Consulting.” Look at the child topics based on the funnel stage: \n",
      "Top of the Funnel Middle of the Funnel Bottom of the Funnel What is business strategy consulting? Best business strategy consulting firms in New York Business strategy consulting for small business Types of business strategy consulting Marketing business strategy consulting Business strategy consulting for finance businesses  Sales business strategy consulting A landing page on Business Service Consultancy \n",
      "4. Distribute your published content \n",
      "Now that you’ve created your cluster topics and suitable content around them, you must tell the world.  \n",
      "More specifically, it would help to let your desired audience know that you’ve published content and what it’s about.  \n",
      "There are several ways to tell your audience about your published content. \n",
      "Post on social media and groups: Create posts about the problems and solutions your audience seeks.\n",
      "Post them on social media platforms like Facebook, LinkedIn, and community groups to help increase your brand identity.\n",
      "Associating links with social media posts can give you more traffic as well. \n",
      "Email marketing: Send a glimpse of new content to your subscribers. It’s a great way to talk to your audience and keep them engaged. \n",
      "Aside from blogs, send the latest industry updates, newsletters, or other weekly tips related to your audiences’ challenges.\n",
      "It will resonate with them and keep you on top of their mind as an industry expert. \n",
      "Publish content on third-party channels like Medium: Medium is a great place to publish blogs and articles apart from your website.\n",
      "With over 100 million monthly active users, Medium can deliver quality traffic.\n",
      "Influencer marketing: Partner with influencers in your industry and leverage their influence to target a vast audience.\n",
      "It will help establish you as a credible source in the eyes of their followers. \n",
      "YouTube and podcasts: As mentioned earlier, channels like video and podcast marketing are other super advantageous ways to speak to your audience.   \n",
      "5. Collect leads through Forms and Newsletter signups \n",
      "Remember, the marketing team’s goal is to generate sales leads and bring more money to the table.\n",
      "The goal of all the educational content should be to bring visitors down the funnel to your service pages (i.e., landing pages).\n",
      "Your service pages (or money pages) aim to tell visitors about your brand, the value you provide, and the benefits you can bring through your offerings.\n",
      "For instance, Rapidops – one of the finest digital transformation companies in the world, shows their approach on their service page like this: \n",
      "\n",
      "Contact forms and newsletter forms will help you accomplish that.   \n",
      "Insert fields relevant to your business needs, keep the form simple and short, and use clear labels for each field.\n",
      "A simple, clearly labeled form allows visitors to fill it out quickly and not lose interest.  \n",
      "Here, if your CRM software offers web form creation, it’s easier for you to bring all the leads directly into the system for further steps. \n",
      "Step 2: Qualify leads for MQL  \n",
      "You have successfully generated leads and stored them in your CRM. But what’s next?  \n",
